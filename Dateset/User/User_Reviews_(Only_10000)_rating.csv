"my oculus quest is an early xmas present (just couldn¡¯t resist giving it a go). vader immortal i think was included as a black friday deal and is fantastic. i¡¯ve only played a few levels in the training dojo, but it really gets you going. if you need a work out, you¡¯ll get it. i believe oculus is leading the adventure into vr and it can only get better.",1576293814,5, ,125276
"i was surprised to see there is no melee combat. you can stagger zombies and block jumping headcrabs with environmental props, but you can't actually do any damage to them and there are no melee weapons. that said, hl:a is a fantastic linear story-based game overall. certainly the best looking and most polished vr game currently available.",1585453617,3,0,552196

"blaston can be both a stylish ballet of dodging and also the full body cardio session that you can't get enough of!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luujjmxhwh0

lead yourself unscathed through a hail of bullets and plasma from about point black shot distance,
dodge the projectiles in every way possible,
you could even lean back like neo in the matrix or lie on your shoulder to prevent incoming bullets from taking your last hp and defeating your opponent at the same time, you don't only have to be quick, but also anticipatory and accurate.
anyway, 100 squats or an hour of blaston, your buttcheek muscles will know.

in the game you also have a leaderboard and an active online games,
you will be able to play against an ai while waiting for an opponent and the points after winning against an ai will count towards the online leaderboard, you will never have to wait long to find a human opponent, it's a matter of 2 - 5 minutes.
as you play further you will also receive rewards and be able to unlock new weapons that are always unique from each other,
these weapons differ in attack type, ammo amount, loading time, reloading time, ect
besides firearms you will also be able to use protection shields and also throw weapons with empty ammo at your opponent, if you hit well this will also take away a minimum amount of hp, if your opponent throws his weapons at you you can tackle this and throw it back.

blaston is definitely one of those vr games that you will replay on a regular basis anyway,
some games in vr are nice if they don't make you tired, and in blaston you don't mind that at all, even if you feel tired or thirsty, you don't want to give up and take on the next opponent.

highly recommended.",1631228844,4,0,409740

"this game gets a lot of things very right and could be a nice addition to any science fiction fan's vr library.  however the lack of a checkpoint system absolutely kills it.  this is a very fair game.  the enemies fight fair, their layout is engaging, i kinda adore the weapon drawing system.  it's just the game's difficulty is simply derived from a lack of checkpoints and that's the least fun kind of difficulty.  and there's no risk / reward balance to accompany the lack of checkpoints, you just have to listen to the same in-game narration over and over if you find yourself in a tough spot.  the general sluggish movement of your character added to the lack of checkpoints is a tough formula to get behind.  

i don't want to return it as my biggest issue with the game seems like an easy fix and i hope the devs can oblige those of us that don't necessarily love trudging down the same hallway for the 10th time and throwing the same switch.  add the glacial pace of narration from your base ai and the whole thing just kinda drags.  it wouldn't take much to tighten this up and i hope i can change my review soon.

"writing this review in early access so it may not reflect the game once more polished.

tldr i really like this game. it's fun, has lot of potential, awesome level design, difficult enemies, and fun character building.

wow. this is an amazing experience so far. it has the basic premise of ""dark souls in vr"" and with that comes a lot of good and a lot of limitations. 

first, i think the level designs are beautifully done. it has the same feel of going through a small fortress in dark souls and rounding the next corner after slogging through ambush after ambush to finally lift the front gate or unbar the side door to make it so you can return that much faster. 

second, the place this game really shines are the exploration fights. exploring and fighting human sized enemies feels great. especially finding out how to draw out individuals to fight on your terms instead of running in and getting circled. this aspect feels like the ability in dark souls to ""cheese"" enemies to you using a bow or spell and pick them off in one-on-one duels. in grimlord, i wore knights armor to give a balance of magic and physical strength, but no health or mana regeneration. using a shield, two swords, and a staff became my default loadout after a lot of experimentation, but this gave me a good solid defensive option in the shield, a strong melee rush in two swords, and the ability to poke enemies to bring them into the fight with the staff. the enemies have a varied moveset and respond to interactions of their model colliding with you or other character models. if you put your spear in the way of their arm and not their weapon, you won't get the satisfying *ting!* of a parry, but you may cause their attack to go wide and miss you anyway. enemies have a variety of different armor coverings and each one gives a satisfying sound effect to identify what you've hit. the biggest satisfaction early game was finding out that the plate wearing knight indeed did have a small bit of exposure in their suit - between their hips and upper legs, they had no armor to protect their upper thigh, inner thigh, or groin from piercing attacks. fishing with my spear between their legs, or getting around their side to attack with a slashing weapon at an angle i could cut their weak spot was very satisfying - and trying to do this while keeping a guard up to not get hit from the side yourself could be challenging.

third, i touched on my end loadout in the last section, but there's much more to say here. currently, the leveling up system is very limited. you can choose to invest in hp, physical power, magic power, and mana pool. there are also a few points to grab hp or mp regen which can be a life saver. exploration is long, so you'll have lots of time to trickle back your resources in a dungeon. stats can be reset at will so you are encouraged to try different loadouts both with your stats and your gear. speaking of gear, everything is refundable just like with your stats. every piece of gear is made of different materials. if you're done with a piece or want to try something else, you can put your old gear in the smelter and get the materials back. this makes the progression of gear a matter of exploring and finding rare reagents. for example, after beating a boss, i got his magic sword - or rather - i got the recipe for it. it required a sourcestone, which i only had a lower quality of to make cheap staffs. after fighting through the next section of the dungeon, finding a glowing stone in a loot crate lit my face up like i'd found my christmas presents early. with the materials in hand i could go back to the smith and finally make the weaopn. but i only had one source stone so i could only make one of these fun new swords. then after another boss, i got a recipe that required the same stone for a spear - now the question was which one to wield? but since the game makes it easy to respec i got to try both before really locking in my next temporary loadout.",1688430246,0,,141254550
"besides from these two things the game is my favourite on the quest, 1 the annoying circles that affect your vision when getting shot at, why don¡¯t they just make the screen a little darker. and 2 the graphics are great for seeing long distances and stuff but it¡¯s just the textures that can sometimes be really low quality. besides from those 2 problems the game is by far my favourite on the quest along with echo arena.",1596165814,5, ,230569

"i'm an intermediate ping pong player, and i feel as if it gets a bit wonky when i do forehand smashes; i've read somewhere that it helps if you look at the paddle contacting the ball and it does help.

maybe i'm just uncoordinated. i feel as if the faster/harder i play the less the physics line up. at lower speeds it's very much like the real thing (granted you have a $300 paddle and an ittf approved table) - for those of you playing with a dollar store paddle and a cheap walmart table it'll feel vastly different, but that's because eleven simulates high quality equipment.

"i have been playing most days for about 2 weeks now so i think i have a good idea of the game. first the good, it is fun, easy to get into, has some teaching ability and it is cool to race others. unfortunately, it also has many issues. clunky interface, bad graphics and animation even for quest 2 (check out the seagull if you want a laugh), flat calm water all the time, boring location backdrops, races that get old quickly as they are all much the same, wind always from the same general direction, a system that rewards those players who wait until late into the session to play because you can actually watch exactly how the previous players have raced before you have finished their turns allowing them to basically cheat by copying and maybe improving on their times. as for the live multiplayer, the one time i saw enough people for a race and joined the race was full of bugs, some had a completely different race presented to them so it basically did not work. next issue is the price of pro access, 14 eur a month for access to 1 other boat and a few ""pro"" races, i simply do not see the value anywhere, i am not looking to learn about sailboat racing, i already know it, i have been sailing for many years in my own 13m sailboat and raced lasers when i was young. so in conclusion, i paid 20eur for a mediocre game that really needs some polish. 5 eur  is about its worth imo. i really hope the developers continue to improve this game, it has great potential, it's just been released at the wrong price and before it is really ready.",1646602380,5,"Thank you for your feedback SpinDreams.

it seems like there is a new map to play every time i hop on. the ability to play on a course you don't own, as long as someone in the party owns it, makes the game very accessible to everyone.

                     this game is very fun and challenging. i really enjoy the difficulty level and visual style. 

my biggest complaint is that the narrator that gives you pointers and talks during the mission is terrible voiced. emotionless and really damages the mood of the game. 

it would be better to have no narrator if the only one you can get is terrible!

"i considered the old boxvr to be a decent light workout that was easy to keep up due to the decent integration with its varied music.

the new fitxr is totally different. it feels like you're in a smaller space which makes the barriers a bit more challenging (good). they've also modified the scoring system for the better, with strike speed playing an important part. this really increases workout intensity for me. also it seems more forgiving of misses but has streaks of fast hits.

i think these changes have improved it greatly and i bought their high intensity pack as i can see myself using it more as a fitness aid.

the one thing i wish it had was workouts that require greater foot movement and stretching by having a wider track with the targets coming to the sides, higher, and lower. also having targets swapping sides would encourage wide crosses for flexibility. perhaps even a head butt mode with you having to jump/duck/lean to hit head targets (youd need an onscreen indicator of head position for that to work though).",1596252214,5, ,173453
"absolutely love this one..even in the early access stage. here is why...

1: game has an excellent structure for a vr-rts style of play. i think many rts games in vr should model after the mechanics of this game.

2: you get the feel that you are really standing on the bridge and commanding your fleet.

3: the conquest and multiplayer modes (which are still in alpha) are working very well and still having updates and improvements being made.

4: the developer (discord) is very pro-active and looks into the community reported bugs and suggestions..and has made changes accordingly. 

cons: remember, this is an early access review... so many of the things mentioned here may not be present by final release.

1: there is a bit of a ""haze"" that makes it hard to see the text in the end of missions and sometimes the game goes to this full ""white out"" when warping out of a mission area. this only seems to happen with graphics settings to full.

2: the missions maps do feel a little repetitive as they all seem to have an asteroid belt in the same spot and the area of play seems to be the same. i am sure the map variety is of a lower priority while the game is being developed at this point and will be improved later.

system usage: (gpu-z)

i run the following:
amd ryzen 7 2700x - stock prism cooling fan
16gb ddr4 3200 ram (gskill)
b450m+ tuf gaming motherboard 
rtx 2080ti (evga) with the stock dual cooling fans
room temp is usually around 68 f

the game on high graphics settings - gpu temps up to 73 c  and averaged about 65 c total. game put my cpu temps to 65 c and 55 c average. game utilized about 5gb of ram and 10.6 gb of video memory.

on medium graphics settings - gpu and cpu temps were identical to the above.  game utilized 4gb of ram almost exactly 1gb less on these settings and 6.4 gb of video memory.

honestly, the medium settings vs. the high settings showed very little difference in visual quality but still ramped temps up the same.

i have been under a lot of stress lately i have been going through a divorce my own fault i admit but still it was stressful for both my ex wife and me both her most of all.  in the beginning of all this sh was very angry with me and i didn¡¯t blame her i deserved it but it stressed me big time and using my tripp meditation in the morning and at night helped me relax a little bit and get through the rough times. now our divorce is final and she has moved away but we are still friends. i continue to use my tripp every morning and every night because i also have ptsd and it helps me deal with my anxiety from the ptsd!!,1624850614,5,"Hi!

"it's basically zelda in vr, in both actual game-play and style, as well as how its entrance was timed during the early first wave of vr. you swing your sword and get the gold. there is no princess to save that i'm aware of. you can find many like games and clones of this that look similar, but are not nearly as well put together as this. it's not terribly challenging, you're kinda just along for the ride, which takes a healthy hour or so to beat. it is important that you play this game first if you really have to do skyrim vr (mainly out of respect), but otherwise, it's not as 'important' a game to taste today as it maybe was back then, if that makes any sense. 20 bucks is more than fair, but it's one of those games you'd want to stuff into your bag of holding come the nearest steam sale.

sadly, i do have a couple of issues that are holding it back from being 5 stars though. the first and most frustrating is that the motion tracking for hitting targets off screen is very inconsistent to the point where most of the time, they only register if i¡¯m looking directly at the target. this is doable some of the time, but breaks down with targets that require you to quickly look away (side slams extending both arms, knee slams, and top/bottom/diagonal slams).

the second issue is a minor one, but i wish that there was a way to queue up several shorter workouts into one longer one to create a custom playlist.

you can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/dozj6algbew

i do not recommend this game. it's a very underwhelming action rpg whose only selling point is the budget-price and the anime girls. however, simply putting waifus in your game doesn't make it any good. 

the physics-based combat system is poor. your weapon gets stuck in enemies. hit or blocks seem to be pretty random. once you have an opening and get a hit, it seems to just be the case of repeating the same slashing action until the enemy stops getting up. 

there's also not much variety. the different ""procedurally-generated dungeons"" seem to look the same for most of the dungeon with only a few changes to the environment. all the enemies are goblins with the only differences being the different armor or weapon they have. however, they all seem to act the same. 

the best weapons are the weapons with the longest reach,  making most of the challenge trivial once you get a long-reaching melee weapon. you basically just spam the same attack over and over. there's just more and more enemies with the increased difficulty. you save the cleric and then just escort her back to the beginning with newly spawned enemies the gameplay is dull & repetitive.

game is running on the unity engine. on my rtx 3080, i was getting a steady 90 fps. i did not experience any serious issues or bugs, but the game did feel janky overall with weapons getting stuck, enemies getting stuck in terrain, or the npc cleric not following you. you do have full locomotion, teleportation, smooth or snap turning, you can set your height, as well as ""leg spread"" which i had never seen before in a game. you can play game seated or standing. there is some ""fan service.""

"best vr game ever. period.
best horror game i have ever played. period.

tl:dr - this game is absolutely worth 360 dollars if you count getting a vr system (oculus quest 2). the barrier of entry is one that may be hard to cross in the beginning, but once you strap the hot brick to your face and experience virtual reality, there is no going back.

    when i first put on my valve index and booted up half-life alyx, i already had some basic knowledge about the game. i knew it was good, it had attention to detail, and had some really good mechanics.

    oh boy was i not prepared for the physical and emotional roller coaster of an experience. this half-life game, masquerading as an action-adventure-thriller-shoot-em'-up, was actually an excellent psychological horror with story, fps, and puzzle elements sprinkled on top.

    i have 100% completed this game, and on my second play through something magical happened. i was still scared. i knew what events were coming down the pike and yet i was still piss scared of passing through some sections of the game. really showed me how saying that something isn't scary goes out the window when the scary thing is breathing down your neck in full 3d with directional audio.

    i won't spoil anything specific, but oh boy, there are three distinct sections that stick out in my mind as being bone-chilling, pants-shitting, cowering in the corner levels of scary. all i need are six words, and those that have played will know. 

- flashlight and aftermath.

- combine smg.

- j e f f.

    now, don't let my description that i just gave fog your judgement. if you think about it, half-life and co. have always been very horrifying games, but since they were on a 2d screen, they never hit the same way. not until now. with 3d headcrabs crawling around and jumping at you while being able to interact with such a detailed and flavorful world that you swear you can almost feel, i would say that the horror elements only enhance the game, not hinder it.

    and i haven't even mentioned my favorite part of this game yet! what elevates this game above so many others in its class is the ability to loot entire rooms with a simple flick of the wrist, whilst never moving my feet. the gravity gloves, or russels, allow you to grab items from long distance, and make this game so much...lazier. yes, that is a good thing.

by simply clicking the trigger, flicking your wrist, and clicking the trigger again, you have the world at your finger tips. want to grab that pistol ammo waaay over there? gravity gloves. want to grab that combines grenade off his belt, arm it, and ""return"" it to him? gravity gloves. want to know your health, ammo, and resin count without having some obnoxious floating hud? gravity gloves. i could go on and on. without these gloves, this game would be such a slog.

and it's not some cheap and boring solution like having items teleporting to your hand anyways. if you flick your wrist and miss the catch on an item, it will fall on the floor, and you will look dumb. these gloves are simultaneously lazy and skillful at the same time. i love them.

other mechanics/bits that i should mention quickly that rock are...

- beautiful graphics.
- forgiving yet detailed gun/reloading mechanics.
- varied and interesting puzzles.
- non-linear gun upgrade system.
- randomly generated loot.
- fantastic character dialogue/motion capture.
- a genuinely interesting and fulfilling story.
- multiple styles of movement and character control.
- interactivity properties with a lot of items/objects. 

in conclusion, 
    this game is a 9.5/10

"hey. i am a beta tester of your oculus go ""dodgeblock"" game. the game is beautiful, with a clear control, with good music, but .... bothers after a few minutes. i want your game to be interesting. with such good graphics, you can make it really interesting, so that players want to spend a lot of their time on it.

i want to share my thoughts on how to improve the gameplay in your game.

1.just fly forward quickly bored. the player does not have the opportunity to fly in circles in the right angle from the rotating geometric shapes. we need a short-term possibility of three second braking for every 30 seconds. so that in inconvenient situations the player can, by clicking on the controller's touch panel, braking before flying into the ring. this will add to the game the ability to think when to take advantage of this three-second braking!

2. laser pointer? why is he? we have to control the go controller as if it were a handle from an airplane or a jet pack. why do we need a laser pointer while doing this? it only interferes. we will need it for point 3.

3. shooting during the flight! people are waiting for the go controller to shoot and destroy enemies or get points when shooting. let the laser pointer be the sight when shooting at flying objects. what kind of garbage for example. when you hit it, there will be a beautiful powerful explosion (you can make it in 2d). points will be awarded. you need more visual effects, more noise during explosions! so that it would be amazing for the players to feel strength and energy !!!

4. in order for players to have an interest and desire to go through the game, further changes in the visual design of the levels are needed. suppose that there will be no further cubic space, but a sewer pipe, mountain peaks, trees, and the like. there will be new flying enemies. only in this way will you interest the player so that he wants to go through the game further.

5. how to get more income from this? when you implement my ideas, then you can release a free demo game with one level. plus give a few keys for a full game to several players who are ready to write good reviews in the oculus store. the demo game will give you an increase in new customers by about 30%. positive feedback will give a 50% increase. with a game cost of $ 3, this will be a good income for further development. plus, you will sometimes arrange discounts up to $ 2.

wish you luck! i hope for further cooperation with you. i am from russia, i am writing with a google translator.

"the problem is simply that vr immersion is lacking in this game.  after 20 minutes, it just feels like i'm playing regular skyrim, but this time you get free motion-sickness and eye-strain with it.  you might as well just play skyrim se or vanilla skyrim at this point.  it's not surprising considering that its a vr port of an already decade old game using an engine being held together with duct-tape.  i was able to get it during the sale, but it wasn't worth it, so refunded.",1607024072,0,0,606257
"yeah, contraversy or other crashy blageddy bloo.
if you can run this game properly as i can, it's one of the best real adventure / horror games for vive so far.

it being an actual game, it reminds me a lot of half life 2 combined with left 4 dead sans the physics puzzles. more of a traditional key-finder, puzzle solver >> progress to more awful things.

very simple but in its simplicity there is depth and drum-roll... a story. the character you play is actually interesting and i haven't finished it but i am compelled to. i expect there is a why to discover through this morass. 

raw data - great fun. bullet sorrow, excellent but too predictable. but this..  is on another level. 

only the solus project has really brought this level of storytelling to a game made for vive. now there are two that can stand on the platform of what we expect out of adventure games.

so, bravisimo. i can't wait to finish it. alas, i have to sleep. i could say more but spoiling it would make me a bad person. squeeze the duck is all i can say.

i played this for almost 3 hours in a single session, standing, shooting, dodging, ducking... i never play vr for more than an hour at a time. it's that good.

just play it. you won't regret it.

if this is evidence of what is to really come with vr games (as gruelingly tough as they are to make well) we all have a bright future. one big step forward into such a new frontier.

"fantastic cricket game with heaps of great gameplay options!

super realistic graphics are great for immersion, with tons of game options including my favourite the wagon wheel - where you need to score runs in certain areas of the field to win, great for improving your all around batting style. 

biggest 2 suggestions would be lowering the bowling difficulty - even on easy its very very hard for any of my friends to try it out (even with a bat shield on), i would suggest having a 'beginner' bowling level - where it's much slower and easier for beginners to try out the game and enjoy it, and not get frustrated.

"after recent developments, i at first didn't truly consider making a review. i wasn't very keen on leaving a review that would recommend against this game. however, especially with the review of a friend of mine which did get quite a bit more attention than i thought it would, i decided to give my support since i agree with most of the points made in that review.

the responses on the review were out of depth. junt stepped in as public response but also left a review which has since this review been removed.

[u] why developers should definitely support, but never review their own game [/u]
as a developer, marketing, pushing your game out is something you definitely want to do. and i totally would too. however, ""reviewing"" your game, saying it's all great and talking about your own product leaves very little room for feedback. be it brought from me passive aggressive. i will not deny this. i even left a message on junt's review, and shortly after that review has been deleted. you'll simply have to take my word for it that it was there unfortunately as i have no proof of it anymore since it has been deleted. however my wording there was simply pointing out that it might not have been the wisest decision to leave a review on something you work on, my harsher descriptions followed suit on another review (rokuyaa one on here. it's trending a wee bit).

in any case, this was the first thing i noticed before i even almost wanted to leave a positive review (at the very least still recommending the game, despite it's shortcomings which i will cover shortly after it's pro's.

[b] pro's [/b]
unique mechanics i dreamt of playing in vr since i've been playing csgo. an actual shooter that you can play tactically, working guns, aiming, intense atmosphere. blood rushing cool if you like playing not just good oldies maps from csgo, but also community created content with other custom game modes.

the weapons are amazing honestly, even though to some other people's complaint ""not realistic"". i think if you'd go too far realistic it becomes more of a niche development which i think pavlov was never intended for as i saw it anyhow. for people picking it up casually or on higher level you can have fun with the guns. they do simply work.
you have a wide variety of weapons to choose from. the update 24 will add to that collection. more on that later.

the maps are loads of fun, especially the first couple of times if you walk around in 3d spaces you recognize from the csgo oldies i mentioned earlier. the whole game play however, is not the same as in csgo. simply because you hold the items physically and or walk through the maps in a different way because of it. you can do other things in vr than what you could not in the 2d equivalents. amazing experience.

gameplay modes people are used to is another fun pro, what i liked even more were the modes that weren't even really from the main game. take the ttt (trouble in terrorist town) for example. a game mode used in several other games as well where you have to figure out who's a traitor or traitors amongst a group of innocents and a detective. the only people who know what they are are the terrorists and the detective. the rest has to guess or figure out properly to find who the bad guy is. can be a lot of fun. some other modes have been added during the nr 24 update.

so with these basic descriptions. the game in it's core, is not bad. as it played it wasn't horrible. and i definitely have enjoyed myself so i actually wanted to leave a positive review before i got a horribly professionally suicidal response business wise from dave, one of the devs.

[b] cons [/b]
there were a variety of smaller issues. bugs well known among long term players. examples are: bomb time delay glitch, scope walling glitch, server loop glitch, bolt action rifle's with a horrendously annoying (only amusingly useful in one zombie game) fire sound glitch. and so on. these minor things, should have been patched long before this 24th release of pavlov and or other updates the developers have been pushing out in the mean time. it made for some really annoying situations, if not minor most of the time luckily. however, development wise i think this is super lazy and should have been patched a lot earlier.

one of the last nerfs, which is again more of a development point, is absolutely childish at best. one of the guns is suddenly not ""firing in auto"". for those who are less familiar with the update im talking about the aug. it's another one of those signs that totally makes no sense effort wise. you could at the very least keep the weapons core firing functions and or nerf it in a way so it equals out more with other guns the way other bigger devs have been doing decennial.

now in the other review we talked about toxicity. the one i commented in at least. i also gifted the person the game so i could play with him together. anyhow. i do not blame the developers for having a pretty high toxic level of players in the game. there can be super nasty people. 

however, the point where it did start to become something the dev's could regulate. vrml. don't get me wrong, having competitive game play is stupidly (not meant negatively) popular. and when a game is more popular it markets itself. fans are watching, more people join in, investors at events and so on. but the problem in pavlov is that they play among much lower leveled people. this doesn't leave any room for players that can't play anymore on their own level. and worst of all, which does not occur on all league players (vrml are like the pro players just like you would have in csgo) is that their toxic behavior at new people, even though you are an indirect representative of the game is unforgivable. this behavior has only increased in the past time i have been playing and less and less snd maps are played anymore by the more casual side of the public. just a divide between casual and or competitive, again done before by other developments which i don't have to repeat here. would have given a lot more room for growth for new players that stay for longer and attract more people.

the general development in this game, which is my absolute largest point of my cons next to the response i had from none other than dave himself. is hiding behind excuses to why this was taking as long as it did. not just that but the response professionally wise was abhorrent. calling me an entitled brat at 28 years of age is the least thing i expected from their own developer platform. 

some of these smaller issues you can read up in their release notes should have been hotfixed a long time ago. not to speak about other minor additional hotfixes they need to release now. to me a missing menu button showing up as a missing texture or ""yellow block"" just tells me how little attention, detail or quality has been given during working on their current update. not to mention they were aware of many issues even before the major update was released. it just shows you really do not care about the proper progression of your game as a whole. but more catered towards the people where you get investments out of and or from (vrml). i can guarantee you, that if you keep going this pathway, not in the certainty of the  game completely dying out. but most likely losing it's marketing value as a whole if you are not going to attract more people in the long run with things that other companies have already done successfully.

the main reason for me to now not recommending the game, is the horrible response from the dev's themselves. especially dave. play it if you want, but i recommend to stay clear of this game to where it is headed. don't call people entitled brats if you don't even take time to care for a menu button.

*edit 13th of june 2021* only reason im going back to this title is because of requests of friends of mine. i still recommend against this particular title regardless. only buy cheap or with friends.",1610242027,3,8,573397

"been playing mmo¡¯s since the ultima online days and as immersive and life consuming as some have been wink wink ffxi i¡¯ve always wondered what it would be like to actually be in a game actually casting spells or swinging a sword. 

this game is a great start of what the future may hold with immersive mmos where you don¡¯t just control the characters you are the characters.

i¡¯ve been playing as an archer and roaming the landscape shooting baddies with my bow and arrow has never been more fun. running into other players and just saying hi or asking a question with real time voice responses only adds to the immersion. when i¡¯ve had enough fighting i¡¯ve gone to the local river for some fishing. at the end of my time in the wilds i return to my home in town and craft potions in real time by mixing ingredients in a cauldron.

i¡¯m only level 10 at this point and have tried a dungeon yet but i can¡¯t wait to see what else this game has to offer. initially i was nervous about the price of entry, but i don¡¯t regret the purchase.

if this is just the start the future of vr mmos is looking bright.",1580441014,5, ,178399

"i thoroughly enjoyed this!!
a new kind of movie experience. i loved the dark theme and visuals which featured ground breaking camera work, angles and interesting persepectives.
a different way of telling a story, a very immersive experience i found myself riveted to my spinning seat!!
it really felt like i was there!! 
it's genuinely terryfing in parts with a couple of jump scares thrown in for good measure.
definitely not something for your kids. it's very dark and quite violent!
the scope and vastness off the environments i have never experienced before.
some highlights (without giving anything away) were leaning over the edge of the elevator into the vast chasm of the mine and i had to catch myself from fear of falling or when the camera settles right in front of the terryfing main character as he looks up and for a second i totally forgot that i wasn't actually there and that he wasn't actually looking into my eyes!! 
very creepy stuff. it sent chills down my spine!
the sound is equally as good. great voice acting and the soundtrack is flawless from protector 101.
really adds to the tension and atmosphere of the immersive vr experience.
i highly recommend this especially if you're into sci-fi or horror.
this is the kind of stuff that's going to change the move industry and video games alike.
very revolutionary stuff!
my only complaint is it's leaving me hanging for more and to find out what happens next.
please bring on part 2!!

"just wanna chill and play a fun shooter, but there are too many problems to have a good time with this one. firstly, lag benefits the lagger. players with 300ms will turn corners and kill you before they've even become visible on your screen. weapon balance feels a bit off. some assault rifles cannot kill with a single headshot at long range, but some smgs can, and the bolt action rifle cannot one shot to the body, despite being pretty difficult to use. this is where the mechanical problems end, however, it has a slew of other kinds of issues. 

lobbies are filled with 10 year olds, throwing curse words, slurs and hate speech for the entirety of it, so you're better off just leaving chat turned off. between rounds, there are drawing boards, and these same kids can be found drawing swastikas, dicks, and more hate speech. everybody votes for artifact, which is basically the counter strike game mode, and while i don't mind playing it, it would be nice to try some of the other modes from time to time, and there's no way to queue into a game mode of your choice. i want to keep playing this, because the gunplay actually feels excellent and it's satisfying landing killing shots on people, but when you die and you can see the trajectory of the bullet that killed you, and it's striking the air 4 feet to your left due to latency, it can be pretty disheartening.

i'd be able to look past a few of the mechanical issues, but stacked on top of the issues surrounding the lobbies (which i understand aren't the devs fault, but still impact my ability to enjoy this game) it's just not something i could recommend.

"i was one of those who played the original half life when it came out, and every game thereafter. hl: alyx is the best half life game i've ever played, and the best vr game i've ever played. the storyline is perfect: their ability to go back in time yet still provide a new story that is not only not insulting to the player, but also tying into the events of the half life story without destroying what is already in place was epic. my only criticism is that you can't propkill things or use props as weapons; many times i wished i could beat a headcrab to death with a pipe only to not be able to do so. everything else is perfect. 10/10 would play again; in fact i think i will probably play it over again.

1- the fact that when i try to move or looking at another direction it gets dark is so bad experience for quest users like me.
2- it's not google cardboard, for paied experience i expected to interact with some objects like to touch the horse or to take a chair but i can't even see my hand there so i think it made for google cardboard not for the quest.

"yes the game has a fair number of things that need to be added/tweaked. but so far, it is still very enjoyable. i am a lefty, but i am making it through the game anyhow. i'm not a fan of teleport, but its tolerable once you get used to it (besides the sound effect it makes every time - that could go away and i would be happy).

i'm going to recommend this game. yeah teleport sucks, no lefty option, and sometimes the game has to load for a second and you end up seeing a black screen for one second, but this can all be fixed.

there are some things that redeem the game. the graphics are really great, it feels quite polished and you can see the production value. the doom atmosphere is felt 100%. this is a genuinely fun game. i preordered, saw the initial reviews and was debating a refund. after playing about an hour, i can see this game is going places so long as the dev supports it.

Hi!

I would like to let you know that, from the time of your review, a considerable amount of time has elapsed. In this time, a lot of improvements have been made to the game.

For example, on the 24th of September, we released an update in which we added a multiplayer co-op campaign mode. 

Now, you can play the game together with friends.

We have a lot of other cool updates on our roadmap, and these updates will be free for existing players.

For example:

1. Close combat (melee weapons);
2. Horde mode (endless, multiplayer);
3. A new chapter.

Should you like it, we would appreciate it if you might increase your rating for our game.

Should you have any further questions, you can always write us at info@dream-dev.com.

Thank you very much!

Regards,
Dream Dev Studio.

Hi ALonelyOwl,

Thank you for your review.

It's a great pity that you faced the bug in our game. 

Please, help us to understand what and at which moment happened. This would help us to recheck and fix it in the next updates.

Do I understand correct that before the update of the game you had some progress, then you clicked update to the new version of the game (with Secret Rooms), then ¨C after updating ¨C you clicked Continue in the game and found yourself in the Save Room without weapons, keycard and ammo?

Did you perform any additional actions?

Did you try to start the game again (new game), progress to any of the Save Rooms, go out to the Main Menu and click Continue again?

Any information will be helpful for us.

We¡¯ll be grateful if you find a minute and write us at info@dream-dev.com.

Thanks.

In addition, we would like to let you know that we keep developing the game further by making the new updates. The next major update will be with co-op, after this ¨C melee weapons, horde mode, and the new chapter...",129430

ovrshot delivers on the promise of fast paced, intense vr fps action. unfortunately you may need to go out of game to get a match...

the overall feel and flow of ovrshot is fun. it does feel very similar to the flow of game like overwatch

the controls are very intuitive and easy to pick up. this is especially nice since the game is aiming to be faster paced. the smoother the controls are the less fumbling you're going to do when an enemy surprises you.

options galore! i love options. especially when it comes to locomotion. blink and dash teleports along with free locomotion are your main three options which can each be customized further with other comfort options. overall i just liked what i saw here. these guys are a standard others should look to.

i was afraid the classes wouldn't really feel unique with everyone using a bow. the ability kits really do give each class an individual personality. i'd love to see more classes added and a visual differentiator between classes. i'd like to be able to tell a defender from a scout at a glance.

2 game modes with two maps each. king of the hill is your standard control point map while demolition is an assault the point map. both felt very similar to a round of overwatch with each being a best of 3 for the win. 

graphically, there's nothing to write home about with the game but it's not bad either.

things i wish they could have done better.

the audio in the lobby was fairly non-existent. it was a bit off putting as soon as i got into the game. it felt like something was broken.

i didn't notice any way to see the time remaining for each match. this is an important piece of information and i hope i just missed it somewhere. if not, i'd like to see it added.

this is an early access game. the devs have been updating frequently however it's not yet a finished product. there do still seem to be some bugs that need squashing. i'm not sure if my controllers bugging out were the result of the game or steam but it required me to restart steam vr for them to come back online correctly.

most of that feels quite a bit nitpickey. the main negative for the game is the population. i tried to get a match going on a sunday afternoon/evening and wasn't able to get any players. you're likely going to have to set up matches in advance via the games discord channel or some other social avenue. it's rather unfortunate that you've got to go outside of the game to play the game tbh. unfortunately it's a problem that plagues these multiplayer only games. it's hard to generate the population to support them.

overall, even though i was just fighting bots, i had quite a bit of fun with the game. if you don't mind having to setup a match outside of the game ovrshot was quite enjoyable. if you're like me and would rather just use in game options... check back when the game officially launches. hopefully that will draw a larger crowd.",1535994252,3,0,704372
it is pretty cool,1653922800,5, ,147232
"a hilarious and rather massive update to the original accounting. this one costs some money, but it's easily worth it. if you liked the first game, you have absolutely zero excuses not to buy this. it's hilarious, well acted, well written, and has some amazing music. buy it.",1578815685,0,0,746180
"personally, i quite liked this game. the main 'story' was extremely short and there were some things i did not like, but overall, it was fine, just not good enough to warrant its price in my opinion. if this game would've been like a couple bucks, yeah sure, but 21, or even half of that on sale, not worth it.

the art style is great, it's cute, it's nice and i like it.
the gameplay itself seems to revolve mainly about gathering items, crafting new ones with them and then giving them to the creatures that want them, aside from that, every island has a small 'puzzle' mechanic, if you want to call it that. there is a maze (which is tiny and boring), there is a crystal music thing (which is kind of interesting, but also really basic) and there is one where you just plant stuff, which is less of a puzzle and more of a chore. i will not go into any more detail than that, because there isn't much more to say. the islands again, look nice and visually really different, but looks aside, they are not too interesting.

after the 'story' where you just solve the puzzles, the game just kind of expects you to keep going at your own pace. finish building what you didn't finish yet, or just build your own stuff. i do think there is a tiny bit more 'story' but i doubt it'd be much.

to get from island to island, you have a boat, which is tiny but it does the job. it is a little annoying to go from one place, then to the other, and then to another when it does not feel like it has any purpose. traveling by boat feels more like a loading screen than anything else. i can't do anything while i'm waiting to arrive at my destination. sure there are some animals that jump sometimes from the water, but nothing too crazy. 
what is also quite annoying, is that there is no fast travel. there are portal-looking things on an island in the middle which i was hoping would have teleportation, but nope.

the building in this game feels quite awful to be honest. placing something down just requires you to let go of the grab button. whoever though this was a good idea, sorry, it's definitely not. when you create a fancy fence for instance, you create 3, which is nice, but you often only need 1, so i tend to sell the other ones. selling something, requires you to put it in a little area inside of a container of sorts, and guess what happens if you let go while slightly outside of the hitbox of the selling thing, you place the darned fence down. same for if you want to store the item in your boat's chest, if you do not hover over the exact bubble (item's are stored in little bubbles), you place it down instead, it's really annoying.

honestly, it does not feel like the islands are made for making your own buildings, which makes most of the extra items feel extra useless. i cannot just build my own home on the water or in a place i like, since those main buildings are stuck where they are built (you have to build them for some creatures, so you do not get to place it yourself) and since there is not enough space to build my own and not have it look cluttered, it just does not incentivize me to build fences or anything else.

the planting also is mostly unnecessary. every resource you can find in the wild, so unless you need a lot of one or compost it is literally just choose to plant and wait or just teleport to where the plants are. i think it would have been smarter to let the shop sell some seeds instead, oh well.

i think the game's idea is great, though its execution as well as the price is just poor. the story is short, the building is not fun, there is no easy way to clean up materials strewn all over the floor if you don't have chests and the boat doesn't feel like it has enough of a purpose.
this game is 21 euro's (20,99 ig), i would never spend that much on this. i got 3 hours so far and i already feel like i did almost everything.

i think there is potential for a boat game with islands filled with resources, but this isn't it, sorry.",1714780475,0,,164209990

"wow this game got good.  i had originally bought the game when it first entered early access, and it was just too rough for me to stick with, so i initially refunded.  i always had the intention of coming back to the game once it got deeper in development, and i'm glad i did.  so atmospheric, i'm on edge the entire time i'm out on a mission.  its just so put together i can't believe its the same game i refunded.  first off the tutorials are so much better at introducing the mechanics of the game, i actually felt prepared when heading out on my first mission.  of course all of that preparation goes out the window when you're being closed in on by anomalies and those terrifying spider creatures, dropping clips and running like hell. the controls have come a long way, when i started out it was hard to do just about everything.  now most everything feels relatively intuitive, the backpack is useful now, whereas it was a pain for me to use back then.  the map is so much better. i had trouble with guns at release, but now they all just feel so good.  the game will teach you to prepare for missions the hard way.  i made the mistake of not checking my watch when starting a mission, and right when i was arriving at my destination it started getting dark and really just pushed the intensity of the game into overdrive, i was borderline panic mode at every sound.  every time i get back to base i love unpacking all my loot onto the shelves in my room, its just so satisfying.  not too far into the story yet, but its already way better than first release, which i hardly remember there even being much story initially. the game hasn't hit full release yet but whats already here is more than enough to keep you busy for a long time and blows most vr out of the water.  get your heart rate up, buy the game.",1658300152,0,,119120670

"i have seen some dislikes on the review page, talking about how zombies/walkers spawn in when from far away.
my word about that?
nobody cares. it doesn't remove the realistic features of the game, if you cleared out all the enemies in the map then it wouldn't been as exciting. the game wants you to be on guard the whole time, never putting your gun down to rest. it wants you to be active and alert

pros
- game has many features to keep you busy, from secret recipes to easter eggs
- zombies react to noise which can add to immersion
- zombies break doors which adds to the key part of staying on guard
- amazing story line and mechanics
- environment acts well with the immersion
- gun jamming which can make it harder if you use guns a lot (melee recommended)

cons
- ai doesn't respond most of times
- weapons break quickly
- the stamina of the tourist is equivalent to a middle-aged heavy smoker
- you crap yourself when zombies explode doors (i learnt this the hard way)

but apart from the questionable ai and the heavy smoker stamina, this game is an absolute masterpiece and i could not recommend it enough to any new vr users, this game is a must play.",1609584791,3,4,742839

in this game everything is well executed and you can feel the love and care they have for this game. lot of cool stuff seems to be prepared for us in the near future¡­

scenarios are harder and longer than i thought and yet still achievable. it s highly replayable since its randomized, new crowds, playing with different characters , friends etc.

i feel like playing a tabletop moving diablo ! really cool ! and addicting! and surprisingly works way better than expected. it has action, social, adventure, storytelling, choice, strategy - really well rounded game

standout things for me are the fact it makes a change to have a game that's so easy to pick up and is relaxing, rather than having to flail your arms around, or prance about the room like you're having a fit.

multiplayer private games are great, as been said by others, and that's the main reason i was interested, as during this pandemic and seemingly never ending stream of lockdowns, it looked like a fun way to keep in touch with friends and family. i wasn't disappointed.

"first let¡¯s get past the main issue some people have with vroom: galleon, it¡¯s not a game it¡¯s a vr experience instead, and in my option a rather good one at that.

it has plenty to explore and interact with and the touch controls work well with this experience and i like the fact that you get both a ship with items to examine and an island to explore.

on the ship you need to explore and interact with everything to get to the island, and climbing the rigging gives a very real feeling of height, just don¡¯t try and grab on to the mast to support yourself like i did as it¡¯s not really there. 
then you need to get the ship to move you to the island so you can explorer it as well.  
hint if you are having trouble getting to the island think about how you would control a real ship of this size and type.

so in summary, if like me, you like exploring new thinks in vr that are hard to do in real life, then you will probably enjoy this vr experience.  on the other hand if you are looking for yet another fast action wave shooting, go play something else this is probably not for you :-)",1482189647,3,1,446878

"so, prefacing the review by saying that this is my second review to the game, after the fist turn around the game having felt a vr disaster for me.
in a nutshell: i am blind from my left eye which among other things hurts depth perception, reduces  the vision angle, and helps my brain trip itself up on a few things. because of this the game initially felt unplayable as i missed a majority of notes on my left side and trying to compensate it by side stepping put me a bit out of balance.  while i saw the positives in the game, these negatives out-weighted everything so i had to return the game.

my review however was noticed by one of the devs who went through quite the hoops to reach out to me (again, my apologies and my thanks pawel) and ask me to give the game another spin, following certain settings and to go from there. the experience was a massive shift for the better. the game still poses a challenge to me even in the lower difficulties, but suddenly i could finish tracks and actually managed to score a perfect (normal difficulty, still...)
for that alone, major kudos, as it was just another review that could've been pushed under the carpet, but this speaks volumes of a dev trying to be as inclusive as possible.
will add a little tidbit at the end of the review about this.

with that out of the way...
---
coming from beat saber with a hundred something hours (exercise pace mostly), i will have expectations on a vr rhythm game - but with several folk trying to sell me synth riders, i just couldn't say no to the try. 
i was both surprised, amused and could get a similar level of exercise as i got on beat saber, so we are off to a good start.

the absolute positives:
- mechanics
the gameplay mechanics are simple, but provide a combination of different elements that not only help the game not feel too mindless but also encourage both movement precision and a small part of strength. although you can try to slash your way through the stage, it'll be like your virtual sabers are a palm long, so you're better off either punching the notes or waiting for them to come for you. depending on the game mode, precision or force will be more valued, so you can choose something depending on how you feel your stamina and arm muscles holding up, so i feel it's a good way to help extend your sessions. 
the scoring system will be based on building up a combo and how dead-center or how hard you hit the notes, with misses being the combo breakers, so even if you don't score perfect hits all the time so long as you poke the notes you're still in the game to feel you get a good result.

the base modes are rather linear (the notes come surrounding the center of the play area), but there are modifications available to make things more challenging or spice up the approach to the game play by allowing the notes to come from different directions, play around with the notes colors and so on, so for those looking to the competitive side there should be some variety here to try and climb the ladder.

- music selection
down to personal taste of course, and again comparing to beat saber, but when you want to know if you can get into the game i feel that having a choice of levels to play from is a good thing and in this case the levels are musics. i felt i had to move over to custom musics on beat saber very quickly as i couldn't stand the majority of the base songs, while on synth riders i've been given some rather enjoyable tracks across a coule of genres, including a few more tracks for free download too, after which you may consider the dlcs and there's too access to custom tracks, and in regards to that

- native feature support
vrm avatars, custom songs, twitch integration, these come bundled in the game off the bat. no need for mods, no need to worry about updates. as someone who needs music for their exercise and waking up to boot up the computer only to find that an unexpected update has cut me access to my workout music and making me have to go through hoops to get into my actual workout session is a good way to ruin a mood, so i feel that with these features and others being baked in straight into the base game it's a good way to avoid those issues. 

- settings
there's a lot of settings for plenty of things, and from what i experienced, a fair share of them is to make the game more comfortable so that's a massive plus. being able to adjust all these things on the fly without needing the game to reload and what more feels very good to setup the game to your taste without having to worry how long until you get back into the action - and though you may only have to set this up once and forget... well, still a good thing i feel.


the arguable:
- better/worse exerciser
i had people repeatedly tell me that synthriders is better for exercise than beat saber because you move more. i don't feel this. 
maybe spin mode would had a twist to this(no pun intended), but unfortunately i cannot play with spin mode, so what i get even with bigger difficulties is a straight track on which i stand on the middle of and move my arms to hit the notes. i don't feel the need, nor the inclination to move side to side to reach for the notes or to ""dance"" around, because i don't have the reach of a saber, so i try to make sure my hands can actually reach for the notes. for me beat saber isn't about wrist flicking neither except where absolutely necessary, and i freely move on my play area a lot making for both a arm and leg exercise. i do want to do an undisrupted workout session and compare calorie burn, but that's for later.

that said however! ... synth riders mechanics force you to use your arms differently, which help synth riders being a complement or a good alternative for those who need to go easy on their shoulders, and for someone who swings a bit too hard on beat saber, this is a greatly appreciated change of pace!

- the visuals
as someone who live streams i try to make my gaming sessions accessible, and in beat saber this translates to me toning down most of the flashiness it comes bundled with. i appreciate the light show that it can put up, and some of the custom work i saw done for it's fantastic! ... but half of it is lost on me, and because of that i do not feel that synth riders' lack of flashiness is a problem.  if anything i welcome it, but i understand that for some people this can be a low point. 
still, i'd urge people to look into the gameplay first, looks second. a good game is measured by what you can do with it, how it makes you feel, and i think that a solid set of mechanics and some good music can drive people to do a lot!

the downsides:
so, i don't do competitive, i have not played the game long, but i don't feel that there are strong negatives much as i don't feel there is about beat saber. but if there was something that aggravated me was:

- the first impression 
something i almost forget as a handicap was reminded to me very quickly, for another personit came as motion sickness because they kind of wanted to rush into the game, for someone else the image was inexplicably fuzzy looking. 
this is a good game, but the first impression made a few people ready to give up. the dev has shown the willingness to help these people, and this should be made apparent as much as possible in the game. though i tried to look at the settings i didn't quite knew what i was looking for, i did not knew the stages available, the option to change not texture, disabling the stage motion. perhaps we are a small sub-group of the whole player base, but if we know that the options are there, we can explore it.",1621162026,4,4,737184

"edit:
last time i played contagion vr (august 12th, 2018) i would have warned people to stay away from this game, due to the game breaking bugs and motionsickness i experienced.
however, after having another go at the game yesterday, i can safely say there are huge improvements to be found this time around:

+ excellent new menus
+ automatic floor alignment seems better(i had an issue with this perviously)
+ interaction with objects & wepaons made easier and more intuative.
+ improved storytelling
+ better tutorial system
+ great options for in-game movement(either free-move or teleportation)
+ game demos are great, reccomend everyone try it before buying.

however, i feel this game still has a way to go in some places, and if you're prone to motionsickness i really can't recomend it. the game has a system where if you're standing close to a wall(or an object you're not supposed to walk through) in game, and more foreward physically, you'll keep your in-game position. this makes me very motionsick, and it breaks the immersion. in other vr titles, if you try moving through an inpassible object, your screen will go black/hazy, and i feel there's room for development on this area.

- tutorial menu overlaps watch/clock menu, making it hazy and very difficult to see.
- guns feel a bit off, but has good settings that tweak this.
- those who are prone to motionsickness will find this game a bit difficult, due to the games movement system with inpassible objects, highly recomend using teleportation to help ease the strain in any case.
- lack of objects you can interact with, e.g. bottles, books, rubbish, etc etc etc.
- still some unintuative object interaction e.g. like quitting the tutorial is done by picking up a book by holding the grip buttons (htc vive) and then using the trigger button, even when there's no promt that tells you to use the trigger button in this manner.

in any case, if you're not prone to motionsickness at all, i think you'll have a good time playing this game, but if you are prone to feeling dizzy etc while playing vr, i'd say take a pass on this one or try the demo first at the very least. i believe this is a good game and i've seen that the developers take it very seriously, which is great! but i still can't give a positive review as i believe motionsickness is an issue that vr titles should deal with, and i haven't experienced motionsickness like this in any other vr games i've played.",1540936076,3,0,683455
lol i have a vr headset,1601543791,3,1,539253
"the graphics style and music is ok - but it can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly basic game. in fact, it's so basic that i would think than anyone spending a few hours looking through unity tutorials would be able to replicate the mechanics. 
you just press forward toward the building you want to land on, and press a to jump, hoping you've picked the correct route, and that you haven't misjudged the distance.

the style looks a bit like mirrors edge, and of course it's about jumping from building to building - but there's no wallrunning in jump,  and there are no bad guys chasing you, or any of the other elements that made me interesting. 

you're urged to try to complete each of the levels as fast as possible and with as few jumps as possible - but it feels a bit like an attempt to add an artificial sense of purpose to the game. you might also try standing on one leg while playing to add to the challenge, but why would you? 

in each of the five (at time of writing) levels, the last jumps are made on square platforms hovering in the sky instead of on buildings. i guess there were no way to get to the highest buildings in each city with the chosen physics otherwise - but that also feels like a bit of a letdown. the game is bland, but at least you were supposed to jump from building to building, which should be cool. when you end up jumping on squares, it once again feels like a unity tutorial level.

it was judder-free for me in extended mode, and the music and artstyle (however simple), is pretty good. if you're into time-trials you may like it - but as mentioned, the game is so basic that there isn't much skill involved, so once you've found the fasted route, it's just about clicking the buttons.

too pricey for such a simple game.

wait. no access to any sort of graphics settings, pointless floaty gpu devouring particles everywhere, non-adjustable colors, and the beats never line up with anything. i got 9 minutes in. did the tutorial and one and a half warm up songs before everything glitched out super hard. the music got slower and slower while the beat matching went further to hell. i had to take off my headset and do a good old fashioned ctrl+alt+del to get it to go away. my computer runs alyx fine. 

i can see that this may eventually be a solid game, but it has a very long way to go. i do like the idea of having punching/blocking/slicing incorporated into a single map. i was happy to find that i could use my left controller to navigate menus (something my grumpy left-handed self always looks for). custom colors are incredibly necessary for people who are already super acclimated to this sort of gaming. red is right and blue is left in my world, and anything else feels wrong. i use the same colors for beat saber, synth riders, audica, and audioshield (okay, i don't really play that last one at all anymore). also, how does pause work? i tried all the buttons and none of them did that thing. i would have loved to check out the automapping functionality, but it wasn't stable enough for me to get that far and the mapping for the default tracks was bad enough.

"started playing a little before the most recent wipe. 

the core idea for the game as well as how it?¡¥s implemented is pretty good imo, lots of qol features as well.

why i don?¡¥t recommend: 

loot spawns suck, 15 hours in and i haven?¡¥t found or seen a single key card. i?¡¥ve watched all the youtube videos and have gone to all the spawns, also any of the actual valuable loot is massive and takes up a lot of room in the backpacks making it were you can?¡¥t really loot much else after finding it. to get the valuable loot you have to go straight to where they spawn once you?¡¥re in, if you find it, you gotta go straight to extraction most the time since you can?¡¥t really carry anything else. there?¡¥s also an extraction timer when you load in so you?¡¥re most likely gonna get stuck just waiting before you can leave. just to end up dying to an extraction camper. money is also hard to come by, if you don?¡¥t get the nuclear night edition you?¡¥re basically just gonna be broke all the time. 

it is a full time job to level up any of these traders. you literally have to no life the game. i haven?¡¥t even gotten half way to leveling up even one of these bastards. actually aids.

the music in the level is outstanding fitting almost every gun shot i make with a beat on the song makes you feel like a real bad ass!
this game is a perfect example of john wick and that one scene from wanted where james mcevoy is running through the factory and killing everyone in sight... but 10x better.

"tldr/thesis: walking dead saints and sinner is the best vr game i have ever played. yes i¡¯ve played pavlov, i¡¯ve played half life alyx, i¡¯ve played beat saber, and i¡¯ve played h3vr. what makes walking dead saints and sinners the best is the gameplay loop, and progression. the story is good till slightly before the final level where it's rushed.

important information before reading on: 
the farthest i got was day 45ish
i got the good ending? (up to personal opinion on how people view the actions and what the point of the game was. i saved someone and killed another, but took a heavy loss of not getting what i needed. no spoilers here :^) )
i have 4 achievements left to unlock

the gameplay: walking dead saints and sinner is one of the best executed functioning games. the backpack system works great, the weapons that are bigger feel heavy and floppy when you're only holding them with one hand. the gameplay feels realistic but has enough unrealistic things and gimmicks that make the gameplay shine more. (for example, your holstered weapons at your hips are floating but it doesn¡¯t take you out of the realism nor hinder the gameplay experience from them.

killing in this game requires a broad motion, not a fast hard swing. takes a bit to get used to but once you do you appreciate the fact that you don¡¯t have to swing with a force that can dent a hole in your wall. the feeling you get when you put in that extra force to put the knife in the head of an undead is so satisfying. additionally the way the limp body dangles and moves with your now stuck knife feels realistic.

the guns in this game are fine. they feel like guns and get the job done. one thing that goes underappreciated is the helpful reloading outlines and the fast reloading. when you need to put a bullet in a revolver or shotgun, the area of insert glows white which is helpful when you're a brain dead baboon who doesn¡¯t know a single name to a single gun or know a simple characteristic of some gun. it additionally isn¡¯t too bothersome or bright. now the fast reloading i¡¯ve seen complained about but it¡¯s more of a benefit than a bad idea implemented. how this work is when you bring the bullet or magazine near the white outline it¡¯ll automatically load it in. yes, this isn¡¯t as realistic but there are a lot of situations where you're stressed and out of ammo when you desperately need it that it¡¯s quite nice to have.

there is climbing in this game. it¡¯s small, and neat. not much else to it, it¡¯s not a large part of the game.

looting in this game is also excellent. you actually open cupboards, you open dressers and doors. it's really well done. yes, you do have the force to grab close items but it¡¯s so nice and i'd rather have that then break my back to grab a can of soup.

finally the enemies. there are two types: humans and the zombies. let¡¯s start with the brainless. the zombies were scary but i¡¯m a lot less scared of them but they are still unsettling. the zombies roam around and only see you if you're in their sight, or when they are right behind you and turn around. they are creepy and will grab you. when they grab you that¡¯s their only way to hurt you. they are threatening throughout the entire game which makes them excellent. the humans on the other hand are less brain dead and most of the time are out to kill you. they have similar ai to the zombies but got shotguns instead of grabbing you. both enemies are surprisingly well programmed and are quite fun and challenging.

the graphics: i am a big fan of the graphics of this game. it¡¯s realistic but cartoony. but not too cartoony. i think more games need to look at this game when to do graphics. the humans look human but not uncanny valley and disgusting. seriously well done with the art direction
the music: the music is okay. good atmospheric and mood setting stuff and shines when an enemy finds you. the horrifying violin is genius and i love it. but in all honesty i don't remember the other stuff.

finally, the story: the story is really good but lacks more choice, world building, show don¡¯t tell, and atmosphere. the choice one is fine. your choices feel meaningful around the end but not really in missions. the problem with one of the ending choices is it¡¯s brought up right before the final level and it seems out of nowhere and not given much thought. the world building is also lacking. the two factions should¡¯ve been flushed out more and we should¡¯ve seen more of their actions. for example, the resistance gets very little shown about them but they are supposed to be some sorta death cult. we never really see this so it feels underdeveloped. that¡¯s my biggest problem with this game, there's a lack of show don¡¯t tell. like one of the final choices in the game is to let a group of people die. the problem is you only hear these groups of people, you don¡¯t actually see or watch these people. so it honestly feels more comical than serious or stunning.

but yeah, the references to old games was a welcome reminder of nostalgia, and the multitasking was great fun. the final boss was hard, but not cuphead hard. overall a great time, recommend.",1561735624,2,0,581445

"it's very good. solid action game with fun puzzles. i'm looking forward to beating it still but i want to get the word out right away on its quality.

pros: 
- physics are fun.
- guns are very interactable.
- enemies are varied and fun to toy with.
- climbing (every vr game needs it)
- its a full game and not just a tech demo.

cons:
- full body ik.. i was a believer with blade&sorcery but it feels like it just gets in the way here.
- guns are really well done but they have weight so they often drag behind. it makes aiming rather wobbly with some larger weapons. i think they need to reduce drag and lower the weight to 0 when holding them.
- climbing.. again, that full body ik just gets in the way. needing to crouch because your legs are getting stuck is silly. b&s handled this perfectly and boneworks needs to take some notes.


final thoughts.. i was upset when i saw hl:a had no full body ik, now i think i understand why. boneworks is a fantastic game and i wouldn't change much, i just wish my body did what i expected it to do (blade & sorcery)",1576052147,4,4,724682

this (above) being the only thing i said in my original review is disappointing. this might be my second favorite vr game next to hl:a. though this game is very simple, i can't help but feel immersed and relaxed every time i launch it. 
i yearn for the day we either get an update or sequel to this project. for what it is right now, it feels as though its an open window to many possibilities, and has a lot of potential. while other vr games are insanely compact and filled with content, i haven't found the same cozy-comforting experience like this, in anything else.
please, i beg you. if the time ever comes for an update or a possible aircar 2, i'll be happily waiting here, ready to play/purchase any more content you have to offer.

"so, where do i start?

gorn is one of the most exhilarating vr games to date! it¡¯s one of the best party games around! grabbing some friends hanging out and taking turns clearing rounds in gorn is one of the best times i have with my friends. they love it, i love it! what¡¯s not to ask for? 

flinging your opponents around the arena is one of the most satisfying feelings you can ever get in a vr game. grabbing that weapon and releasing all your anger on your foe and turning his appearance into a look only a mother could love! that¡¯s one of the best parts!

you know the more and more i play this game i get worried more about my mental state. but who cares? 

i will say be extremely careful when playing this game. so far, i¡¯ve punched my friend in the face, almost put a hole in the wall, sucker punched my monitor, broke my vive controller, and hammered my playstation 4 knocking it onto the ground and had the top of the playstation break off revealing the inside of it.

"played on the index, with vive wands. index controllers are not recognized at all.

the game ran fine at 120hz with 140% ss. i cant imagine any system that is labeled ""vr ready"" having trouble running this.

banana invaders is a pretty basic shooter. upon launching you are greeted with the option to input your name, and either start the game or quit, thats it. i dont know what the holo fame button is supposed to do, but it did nothing for me - im guessing a scoreboard for repeated play?

the game quite simply consists of you standing on a platform and shooting bananas (be they singular, a bunch, or a van load), with the weapons already on your hands. there is little difference that i could tell between the two. one had a slightly larger projectile, with a slower rate of fire. there is no ammo that i could see, i couldnt tell what the ""power ups"" you can shoot to collect do, there is no music, there was a weird floating cut out of some sort blocking part of my view (see pic), the weapons didnt feel that great...

"full fledged single player campaign with a story, and you have to make gestures to throw spells!? hell yeah!.

i tried this game a looong time ago before the enhanced edition and im finally finishing it because i wanted to play the sequel... truth be told i was a bit dreading it because i played this before the enhanced edition was a thing... and i can gladly say most of the issues i had way back then have been fixed or very much improved.

i honestly enjoyed my ~4hrs playthrough i didnt move any graphical settings on my gtx1080 and i pretty much stable 90fps.

voice acting is very good, the narrator voice doesnt annoy, and is funny at times, with witty writing and very understandable. 

audio is great, except i felt some sfx where missing, like stomps from huge enemies when they walk, and some audio queues to audibly locate enemies. 

its still rough around some edges, it shows its age a bit. like the animations arent the greatest, but they are still full of details, like i used a shield on a goblin that tried to stab me, and he looked at his blade like ""it doesnt work? wha..."" and i blasted him with a fireball...

...and some levels could have use more ""life"" they felt somewhat empty when traveling to the next checkpoint.

but still way way better than a lot of of games ive played, it had great effort from the devs and it shows.

there are a considerable variation of enemies, boss battles are entertaining and fun.

puzzles arent that hard, and not that common. collectibles where very easy to find at first, but on the later levels they get better hidden, or are behind a small puzzle.

the game isnt super clear (at least the book that tells you how many you need isnt), but you need to complete some tasks on each level to earn upgrade points, these tasks are almost always based on points, finding a modifier card and 3 shards that are somewhat hidden in the level.

cards you find are modifiers that make the game more/less challenging to help you get through the game, or earn more points to get those upgrade points. 

the best part are the magic spells you cast using gestures, the recognizion is almost perfect, by the time i was through with the game i did feel like a master battle wizard.
i could summon the arcane bullets, use the shield to bounce an enemys shot, blast a fireball to kill him then throw lightning to kill a horde of goblins in less than 10 seconds... 

at first it felt, slow and too easy, but a card that makes enemies a bit more resistant was just what i needed to make it enjoyable for me.

knowing the sequel is supposed to be even better made me buy it (sequel) halfway through my playthrough.

its certainly not a perfect title, but in my opinion its above average over all... and when on sale its an absolute steal.

"if steam had a middle option for reviews, i'd give it that instead of a thumbs down.

good:
it's like a dumbed-down dcs world cockpit simulator. you can do a lot of things that are very similar to dcs, but with only minimal instruction.  so that's actually pretty cool.

convincing weapons and systems.  missiles and stuff work very much like how you'd expect them to. pretty decent range of weaponry too.

mod support and mission building.


meh:
the vr motion controls work surprisingly well, so respect to the devs for that.  but it still isn't anywhere as good as a proper hotas setup.

aircraft designs.   you get some wish.com looking knockoffs of real aircraft like the f-14 and f-35, a generic ""dropship"" cargo aircraft, and then a couple of other things that look like a mashup of a few different planes.  understandable if licensing is an issue.

graphics in general are pretty typical low-fi  vr game graphics.  but while it isn't pretty, it runs really well. 

bad:
voice acting is hilariously bad at times. imagine your high school freshmen buddies larping top gun and there you go.

campaign and mission design.  missions require certain things to happen before you get credit for success, and if you don't succeed, you have to do the whole thing over again.  sometimes missions can have instant failure events too, which end the mission and you have to do the whole thing over.  campaigns are a just a string of missions, so if you fail a mission, you can't progress to the next mission.  i don't think there is anything dynamic or persistent with campaigns and missions. 

the maps are bland and boring.


if you don't have a hotas or a rig for dcs world, and you don't want to play war thunder, this isn't a bad alternative.  i doubt many dcs vets will enjoy it,  unless you just want something different to play when you don't feel like doing the whole dcs world thing.",1703354272,0,,154230117

"here is my 5 cents (cdn$) worth comment. bought it on special, 50% off, great. started playing it yesterday for the first time, i lasted a good 55 min. the graphics are great, what i experienced was, in that short lap of time, great. now you have to understand, i am 66 yo but been playing games since 1985. stood up for a sequence, manage to fall down, yep, put my ass back to the chair to have some balance, but sat down for most of the time. did i mention the graphics are great? this game is so immersive that it is a good thing i couldn¡¯t play it because i am pretty sure i would have died with by oculus rift headset... lol. creepy i know.  yes. i did return it for refund and will get my credit back in about 14 days per steam policy. i was really sick after that 55 min and had to lie down for a good 3 hrs and eat peanuts after on the couch watching tv. motion sickness was way too strong for me, i can¡¯t explain it, i know i would be unable to overcome it, i wished i could have played it, lots of fun in that short time, but will have to find something else now. hope this helps.",1563021239,4,71,607781

"first of all, i played this on a valve index, with the index controllers.

i personally do not mind the fact it's 'another wave shooter', considering i didn't really notice how many there were until [i] after [/i] i had played this and read some other reviews. i was curious about the game, bought it since it looked good, but i really should've done the demo first. this is not a game i'm going to play again, unless it's updated to fix some issues. what issues are these?

1. the locomotion option. this is the most frustrating and the biggest issue i had, right off the bat from the tutorial. first of all, it's a form of teleport, and more specifically, the one where, as you rotate the stick it changes your front location. robo-recall style, as i know it. the problem with this, is that one an index controller, the controls are trying to be merged with that of a vive, and this doesn't work well for the controls. any time i try to teleport, it's finicky, and doesn't like to actually teleport when i tell it to, and it resulted in my first two deaths. there are also no other options for any other style of locomotion, even a second type of teleport. this is an issue for me, as the teleport feature didn't just not work, i dislike using teleport locomotion in vr, as it easily makes me sick, compared to other forms of locomotion (such as a joystick control).

2. the difficulty is intense. combined with the locomotion issue, this caused my two deaths, and for me to quit the game immediately afterwards. i expected the game to slowly ramp the difficulty up, as many wave shooters do, but instead, the first level just throws enemies at you constantly, with very little breaks in between the waves.

3. aiming. it may have just been me, but having to aim to deal with getting health, killing sniper-like enemies, or just about anything in this game was way too difficult. the lasers that come off the guns do not actually project as lasers, they're mainly the way of seeing where your aiming to pick something up, and the range of that. the problem is, they are far too short to aim at actual enemies, and has proven to actually throw my aim off when i was trying to be accurate when i encountered the first sniper enemy. this was my first death, as i couldn't properly aim to kill the sniper before it killed me.

if these issues are addressed, then this game might actually be really decent. until then, this is a game that i am not going to be playing any time soon. i like how the game looks. it's designed well and the music is actually really good. the problems, however, are too big to justify this game getting a recommendation from me. definitely not a game to play on an index, even though it's supported.",1588918315,3,0,370789

"this game is pretty damn good.  other reviewers have commented that this game has a sweet spot between pavlov and onward. i own both of those and i have to agree.  the gun play is by far the best i've ever seen in a vr game.  the ease of adjusting the gun placement on each individual weapon makes this game what i've been waiting for.   i'm sure the others games have this by now, but this one works flawlessly.  you can adjust for smgs/rifles individually and actually use a scope [i]without banging your controllers off your face[/i]. amazing. 
the graphics and maps don't look thrown together.  your lobby is a gun range with moving targets that's a fun game in and of itself.  the gun selection/modification is decent. movement system is typical to vr but they've added a slide mechanic that is really nice. all you have to do is duck while running and you've slide 6 feet.  it actually feels a lot like paintball from back in the day.   
the devs did a good job.  worth the money.  hope more people start playing this.",1571232309,3,0,749688

"tl;dr- if you like art and have a vr headset get it!

i managed to sneak into beta for this pre release and i have nothing but good things to say. 
vermillion is a fantastic and relaxing vr art experience. this is oil painting in vr at its best and without the mess! if you are into art at all; in any capacity, you will feel right at home with vermillion. you can expect to spend anywhere from 45 minutes to a dozen hours on a finished painting, or more. how much creativity you put down on the canvas is up to you.

i was accepted as a beta tester for vermillion and i must say that what it does, it does wonderfully. alone in a room, just you, some windows, an easel, a palette, a brush rack, a browser/menu window, the serene sounds of nature and your creativity.

you can resize your easel at any time so as to cover the entire canvas with a nice backdrop, or so you can get in real close to add those tiny details. you can use straight oil or thin it out to your preference. each brush functions as you would expect it to as if it were real and some can be resized. vermillion even visualizes how loaded your brush is with paint! you do run out of paint with each stroke though, so expect to have to reload your brush as you paint. you can change your grip/hand position on the brush at any time so as to say, get the fan brush into that perfect position to create some foliage with. the sounds for mixing, painting and swishing around the paint thinner are really well done and make you feel ""there"". it is very easy to get lost in painting whether it be from imagination, watching bob ross, or even your favourite youtube artist- all from within vermillion itself. mixing colours is very intuitive if you know your primaries, secondaries etc(if not that is okay, there are youtube videos for that!) and it is an awesome feeling when you get the perfect colour.

as this is a digital interpretation of oil painting you also get the convenience of undoing your last 3 paint strokes in the event that you make a ""happy little mistake"", or you can always reload an autosave. each art piece can be saved and loaded on command. your art can also be exported as a studio picture, gallery picture in 2k, 4k or 8k resolution jpegs on pcvr. i even printed some of mine on glossy photo paper already :)

now admittedly i haven't finished some of my paintings, but it is awesome to know that i can jump right back into any of them at my convenience!

i have experienced this with a valve index and an oculus rift cv1, both of which worked almost exactly the same(minus the sde and knuckle grip). 

the developer is very active in the vermillion discord community. patches and updates have been flying out of the forge frequently leading up to it's release. vermillion is definitely a labor of love! if you are interested in seeing finished results check out the steam community page or join the vermillion discord(https://discord.gg/5y8ntgq4) and browse to ""share your art"" to see what professionals and amateurs alike have created so far!

if you enjoy creating art i highly recommend vermillion for your vr library!",1627425022,0,0,425311

quite simply wow - this has to be one of the most impressive vr solutions out there.  from the credits, it looks like it took about 100 people to make it - which is not surprising if you've played it.

everything: the opening scenes, music, storyline, voice over, artwork, is exceptional.  attention to detail was amazing, and this is a must play solution.

as for constructive criticism/help:
1) the initial set of puzzles (8 rooms and pre-puzzles) are all the same.  while having harry potter read morelike powers is extremely cool, this level of repitition was too long and i just longed for some different kind of puzzle
2) keys - its really hard to understand what a key is... as it looks nothing like a key (think snowglobe on the barometer, grab with open hand). 
3) end sequence was really long and almost put me to sleep.  great story, yet too long.
in summary though... simply incredible work! ",1540177200,5,,5806
i absolutely love this game. 10/10.,1668206694,0,,125319185
"where do i begin? i wouldnt trust anything from this game studio...

tldr;
devs & team dropped the ball on communication, directly insulted customers in discord, failed to notify even 24 hours before the launch date and delayed the game twice, released a bugged out unplayable game (hands lock when grabbing magazine), but added half-developed assets and other meaningless items, and the calibration is very very bad.

i purchased this game on the ""first"" launch day only to have it delayed twice, then i was directed to the discord from the steam forums for asking about updates which i was insulted in the discord and eventually banned (alongside alot of people asking, some journalist)  very rude staff in that discord, when i posted on the steam forums about it i was told it was ""because of my conduct"" which is a flat way of saying ""because we said so"" so for months the topic went blank, very unprofesional (especially the low life banana dude in the discord)

later i decided to play the game once so that steam would allow me to request a refund, the game didnt start on the first try, or the fifth, but after testing my setup on other games (which worked first time) the game eventually ran and i got into the tutorial after a buggy setup screen that repeated the same audio/scene multiple times. the calibration inside of the tutorial was very bad, wherever i placed the chest (which was on my chest) it always put the repair tool in the last 1/6th of my screen blocking my vision, the belt was akwardly placed so that you have to crane your arms to reach your guns (no placeable section allowed a good hold, wearing the belt like a hat would be 1000x better) and afterwards the first thing you find is flailable body limbs, which is gimmicky at best but seems like something the devs were playing with the idea (underdeveloped?) they dont even collide with the environment or enemies??? then all seems like its working fine, shooting is fine, but the reload system renders the game unplayable.

yes. unplayable. eventually after grabbing the magazine the game locks your hand! it gets locked into a fist and you cant use that hand unless you restart, which it comes back! even worse is you can grab the magazine with the other hand too and lock both hands! everytime it happened i got locked at a ladder trying to climb up by flinging myself but the game doesnt really work that way so this game is unplayable.

edit#1: in the trailer videos for the game it shows that you can throw the magazine, this will obviously break the game
  
devs & team, you dropped the ball on communication, directly insulted your customers, failed to notify even 24 hours before you delayed the game, released a bugged out unplayable game, but added half-developed assets and a picture of your dog with voicelines??

"valve returns! (spoiler free)
yes, it's real valve has returned to creating games again. when i learned this last year i almost fell off my chair. but this isn't just a cash grab or a half arsed attempt.
using valves new source 2 engine this is a fully fledged vr game, not an experience, or a short story, but a full game. valve had previously flirted with vr in shorter experiences and demos to show off their new valve index hardware, so it's great to see them return to storytelling again, and that storytelling is excellent. this is set between the events of the 1st and 2nd game, you play, as the title suggests, as alyx vance as she works her way through city 17, battling her way through combine soldiers and headcrab zombies.
without giving anything away the pacing and delivery of the story is amazing. you gradually uncover more as you work through the game, but in true half life style, there are always more questions left unanswered. this game delivered my favourite ending of all the games and left me wanting more. 

gameplay wise this game is a lot of fun, you'll be flicking small distant items of loot towards you using your gravity gloves, which replace the gravity gun from the other half life games, collecting resin to upgrade your weapons, solving puzzles to unlock new areas and of course fulfilling your dream of being a badass dispatcher of all things combine and zombie, all whilst using glorious finger tracking thanks to valves new index controllers (assuming that you opted for them) 
physics once again come in to play with puzzle solving and bringing new and creative ways to traverse the maps and take out enemies.
there are also a lot of accessibility options to those who suffer from motion sickness, from click turning to teleporting, as well as continuous movement options for a more realistic feel. however there are some niggles with this as for certain sections you need to teleport jump to areas which can be a little immersion breaking if you've been using continuous movement throughout. also climbing up ladders in a little strange as you climb up them using your hands and then once you reach the top you teleport from the ladder to the ground slightly in front of the ladder, which feels clunky.

visually this game is astounding in what it achieves, as usually with vr games the developers sacrifice visual elements in exchange for better frames per second. but even with the settings turned to low, this game still looks incredible. so it's a testament to what the new source 2 engine can do. the rich and varied lighting, realistic physics, great particle effects, open environments and dark foreboding areas all add up to something special. sometimes you'll find yourself just stopping and looking around in certain areas. 

the audio is mostly excellent, from the punchy explosions and gunfire, great musical elements which are reactive to your situation. also each area has a distinctive ambient feel to it, from the electrical hum of a combine facility, to the creepy sounds of a dark horror like hallway, and the large soundstage of being outside in city 17. directional audio is also great, you can always tell where sounds are coming from.
my only issue comes from when alyx speaks, it doesn't quite sound like the voice is coming from you, now usually that's not so much of an issue, but in vr, you're literally in the head of the character so the disconnect feels odd. i think it's probably the lack of base coming from the voice, now i know alyx is a lady so i'm not expecting a deep voice, but her voice sounds the same as someone who is in front of you or next to you. it's a minor gripe though as the voice acting is excellent throughout. the often hilarious lines that come from russell over the radio being my favourite. but the performances are much more nuanced than in previous games, delivering a more realistic feel, alyx also has more of a sense of humour this time around so that makes her feel more likeable, relatable and fleshed out.

so in conclusion, if you were on the fence about this game due to it being in vr, or because you play a different character, then you shouldn't be, it delivers its own unique experience, whilst tying into the other games directly. it's a full campaign, with a great story, and if you're a life long half life fan, you need to experience the ending as it actually adds to the other games. i think this is a great vr game, but it's a really excellent half life game. and with the release of the source engine in the workshop, there is so much extra content which will keep you coming back long after you finish the main story. in fact, i'm currently creating my own mod myself, having never made anything before for a game.

thank you valve, and i hope this means a return for more half life games in the future. like seriously. do it!",1597589581,3,0,540222

First and foremost we want to say we're very sorry for our late response to your feedback. We appreciate looking back we should've actioned our early post launch reviews a lot sooner and we only hope you can forgive us for that. Secondly thanks for leaving us some honest feedback and a positive rating. We faced some difficult tests while developing the quest version due to the limited hardware it possesses compared to what a PC can deliver so it's only natural we had to make some sacrifices in terms of the visuals and doing what it took to get the game to run. We'd really pleased to hear the comfort mode worked out for you. We developed it especially to prevent motion sickness from occurring while playing the game and it's good to hear it worked for you. In regards to the voice commands they're something we're pretty proud of and is a bit of a USP for us as there isn't many games where you can control and dictate enemy AI behaviour with your voice alone. Glad you enjoyed that. :) The climbing was also something we intentionally provided to the players to allow that sense of freedom and addition to that feeling of empowerment you get. We created the maps to be scalable across many places to accommodate that too. We're overjoyed to hear you compared us to splinter cell as that was one of our big inspirations when developing Espire. :) Metal gear and goldeneye were two other legendary game franchises that gave us that inspiration too. We're not sure if you kept up with our progress over the last 19 months or so but we've made vast improvements and fixes to the game through various updates. We've improved the graphics immensely, improved the AI behaviour and stability, increased in game performance and reduced loading times among a ton of bug fixes too. We also added additional content to the challenge mode in the form of new categories of challenges that provide some new unique objectives, maps and a couple of new weapons. Feel free to check these updates out at some stage if you haven't already and we hope you enjoy them. Thanks for the support and again very sorry for our late response.",156414

"it is rare to have a great co-op game that integrates one player on pc with another in vr.  vr giants makes that cooperative team up a special experience.  i definitely recommend this game if you have a player 2 in your house, whether a partner,  child, roommate or frequent guests.  

this one is comfortable to play in vr and limits the player to a small area, so it doesn't require a giant room of space.  the puzzle dynamics are varied and don't get boring and helping guide your little caped friend around the different levels can be a satisfying experience as you figure out the best course to take.

on pc, the game plays as a platformer with a dependency on the vr player to help you get to specific places and help you avoid obstacles.

the game does a great job of showing perspective.  the giant vr player sometimes can notice things that the small pc player does not.  the pc player can travel mostly freely while the vr player is restricted in their movement.  it is unique and something that proves to be a great shared experience.",1686779769,0,,140068648

"edit: dropping the score down to 5/10. why do i still play and recommend this game? because they have no competition in this market so they can literally not care about fixing it and people will still play it.

let's add to the list of cons the 2 following points:
1) the hit register is absolute garbage, especially when combined with the potential lag from the dogshit optimization.
2) they manage to break mods and the ability to play custom songs every single patch, somehow.

how they haven't managed to fix this absolutely atrocious performance in over 2 years now is absolutely beyond me.

---

pros:
1) exercise
2) fun simple concept
3) mod support and load of community made content

cons:
1) absolute dog shit optimization
2) only thing worst than optimization is the scoring system... edit: nevermind, the optimization is definitely the worst part.
3) story mode teaches you how to play poorly

...

some explanation on those cons:
1) game manage to dip in performance enough to be an hindrance with a gameplay loop as simple as vr fruit ninja with simpler shapes if you try to run the game with any modicum of quality for recording/streaming purposes even with a pc capable of running games that should require 100x more processing power. somehow, beat saber manages to clog the cpu more than peanut butter can clog a car exhaust if you shoved 200 bottle of the stuff down the pipe.
2) the scoring system effectively encourage you to get carpel tunnel rather than play to the beat. basically, your timing is irrelevant, what matters is how much of your wrist your willing to sacrifice.
3) the story has objectives to miss or poorly cut notes as well as objectives to stand still like a frozen corndog or move like a burning monkey on crack. need i say more?",1578857386,0,0,634343
"pew pew pew!!
this is a nicely done wave shooter.
you're not just stuck in one spot while shooting endless waves of the same object.
there's still a lot of glitches to work out ""like enemies getting stuck behind doors and walking through structures. the game is loads of fun but i'm not sure about the price tag. 


pros
super immersive 
action packed
nice grafx
multi-player capable
able to move around
upgrades

cons
price
repetitive 
still plenty of glitches to work out.

"a fast, agile, first person shooter with depth and tons of fun. 

while it is in early access upon review, the game feels polished and well developed. the guns, the levels, the bots, the movement, everything works and shines in this game.

while this game borrows a lot from games like unreal tournament or quake three arena, that doesn¡¯t diminish the game. the core game play is fast moving, quick shooting, barrage of fun. 

but it is not just all speed and flash. there is real depth to the shooting and movement. there are pros and cons to a variety of ways to play the game, and there is a lot that can be mastered by playing against other humans or against their bots. 

the game also takes full advantage of being in vr. from grappling hooks, bows and arrows, swords, and a variety of single handed to two handed weapons, this game uses the medium of vr effectively. 

ultimately, my only criticism against the game is its smaller selection of levels, but the developers have shown images of a new level, and it is clear they are working hard, and passionately, on this wonderful game!

and at the end of the day, as much as i enjoy vr shooters where i manually have to load the magazine\, sometimes i just want to blast and shoot a gun while i¡¯m bunny hopping down halls and grappling up from floor to ceiling. 

a wonderful game and should be on any vr enthusiasts collection.",1611183054,0,0,403118

2. the running animation is a little weird to play with. have your arms move at very slow running movements has hurt my game play a little bit. (update:: they added the new sprint and it is a much better play) but the five star won¡¯t come until manual reload

"super fun. great fighting experience.

https://youtu.be/akezqxilwou

however... there are some issues. it's not perfect but if more resources were poured into the game it could be the gold standard for fantasy combat.

i'm a sucker for giving the players options and there were plenty here. presentation and explanation could be better but it wasn't too bad. the game is also missing comfort options at the moment for those who are prone to sim sickness.

speaking of locomotion, the speed of my character was pathetic and frustrating. probably the biggest detractor in terms of fun. i found it very difficult to effectively engage or break away from groups of enemies moving to surround me.

character creation was pretty average for a flat game but one of, if not the, most in depth i've seen in a vr title. you have the freedom to tweak your character just right or to make an abomination.

the intense combat. it's raw, visceral carnage and it's fun as hell. and it better be cause it's all the game is... that being said i didn't explore a lot of combat options such as using the environment. throwing people down a well or impaling them on spikes around the levels. i didn't jump or kick. there's still quite a bit to explore with combat.

the audio added quite a bit to the weightiness of the combat. the clunks and clangs of combat combined with the physics reactions really sell the combat and just make it feel good. unfortunately there are still some bugs here such as 43:53 where the bardiche blade passes through the npcs arm and her arms is stuck between the blade and the shaft. among other examples. hopefully this improves as the game progresses through early access.

while nothing to praise the sun over, the graphics were pretty good with a significant number of options here as well.

content. content is quite lacking. i said it going in. this is a combat sandbox and as such there really isn't any ""content"" that you don't make for yourself. once you tire of killing off waves of ai, there's nothing left for you here. it's great as a tech demo and playground but to have any longevity i feel it needs more to it.

remember that this is an early access game at the time of this review so there will be bugs. such as the crash to desktop we ended the video with or the overly attached quiver that wouldn't let go of our back.

i think you could get a couple hours of fun out of this game before it starts to get stale but your mileage may vary. i'm on the fence to be honest. i had a lot of fun but i don't think it will last. we can buy in now on the assumption that there will be a game later but such a promise hasn't even been made and if it had too many devs have burned their fan base with broken promises to recommend on hope of what's to come.

when i'm on the fence about a game i tend to go back to the steam page and compare what was advertised with what we were given. blade and sorcery delivers exactly what it says it will so as such i will lean towards a recommended with the caveat that there really isn't a 'game' here yet. just a sandbox, combat simulator that could very well get quite stale rather quickly for some.",1545395704,3,0,668614

i've played football games for years mostly has been madden the last good madden game that was good and that i enjoyed was madden 12. this blew my mind when i played it's fun even though it's a 2 minute drill it made me feel like tom brady on a game ending drive. i do see more updates for this game the developer has been very active updating the game which i love the newest update added stats and enhanced graphics and updated practice mode. i would love to see a franchise or career mode or even multiplayer even though it's a stretch adding multiplayer as it is hard to code into the game. i would also love to see full games instead of 2 minute drill and sim defense and have the defense let up some scores or just have a points to beat in the game would be great. my final thoughts are 10/10,1614569014,5, ,218148
"at current stage, we get a combat sandbox and semi-random dungeon exploration (linear but tortuous). so what's important are the toys we can play with. there are no story, defined goals or progression.
the range of weapons, objects, abilities and spells is already quite wide, so there is plenty of fun to have. moreover it's very moddable and the community is doing great things.

many feedback effects have very satisfying details, that's one of the strength of the game since the beginning.
update 10 gave us some very good and varied environments to explore, with nice ambient effects (light, particles, sound).

there are some weird edge cases with physics and collisions, that's quite inevitable. also u10 introduced a couple of small bugs and problems that should be ironed out in next minor updates.

what's lacking the most in my view is ai behavior, like many other vr games, though it's improving.
i'm among the people that would like a deep sword fighting simulator. it's not this kind of game, but that doesn't prevent me to enjoy it.
with the physics engine, all the spells and abilities there is a lot of complexity, not an easy task.

overall i recommend it. i get well enough fun either by trying crazy things with the engine and features, or doing some personal challenges. i often simply kill waves of enemies or doing a dungeon run as fast and cleanly as possible with weapon/spells restrictions.",1545001483,0,0,668713

pretty solid wave shooter that is very atmospheric with some cool enemy designs and great atmosphere. due to it's short length it never overstays it's welcome and my only real issue is with the four distinct waves of enemies there is no in game checkpoint system which means that you have to beat the game in one full sitting. but apart from that issue propagration vr is a pretty fun and free vr shooter so there is really no reason not to play it if you own a vr headset.,1602723889,0,0,402151

now beyond my initial hype, the game plays as well as can be expected of an early access game, especially one that promises so much, and for the most part delivers it well. the graphics are acceptable in my headset, i have not experienced any stuttering or movement issues. the enemies could use some design work, i am not sure if the current models are place holders but they seem rather bland. the game is fairly difficult, but if taken slowly it is not unapproachable. learning curve is steep, and i was not always sure how or to what i died as some environmental hazards are less than obvious.

"here's my honest review after playing a few hours.

first off, the mod is good for what it is. it's cool playing though the half-life 2 questline and experiencing it in vr. it's like a nostalgia trip but at the same time it gives the feeling of being something new. just don't expect interactions of a vr only title from this mod.

currently, there are some technical issues and design decisions i don't quite understand. i don't have to insight to say if it's related to engine limitations or whatnot but here are my gripes with the mod:
- the ladders are really annoying to use and they are wonky at best. it would be better if the ladders worked like they do in ""into the radius"".
- using the car boost once makes the car boost all the time until you stop trying to accelerate normally.
- guns are weird and the weapon interactions are sparse at best. they are mostly limited to reloading the gun. it feels like there's a lot of missed interaction potential.
- world object interactions are just ""press the button"" type of interactions. for example, instead of flicking a switch by grabbing it and actually flicking it, you just press ""use"" and that's it. this breaks immersion quite a often.
- the weapon selection wheel is really annoying.
- mags are grabbed by grabbing over your shoulder. this is a feature i personally don't like and didn't like in alyx as well. a body type loadout would be way better.

overall i'll easily recommend this mod for anyone who wants to experience half-life 2 in vr, even if it's (in it's current form) not really that immersive. if you are expecting a polished vr experience, i can't recommend it in its current state.",1663508528,0,,122433881

"(grammar warning?)

im be honest this game freaking great. i've have never seen a game with so much content on quest standalone and it doesn't take 20 gb it's a great game overall. but as the reviewer i must tell the cons as well. let's get the bad out the way

-cons-

-very bare bones mmo. by this mean it barely counts in the state it is in now(talk more on that later)

there are almost no side quest. which become required the higher level you become. 

bugs (of course still early)

only two weapons and sub class related element's. this doesn't bother me as much (another class is planed then the only two)

classes are bit weird as the topic can go. certain classes in the game will be able to survive by them self and some won't. this becomes a problem if you don't have friends and the guild system is like a weird party systems won't really help the later you get. and players become increasingly rare the find when your high level. (this me talking as a 20) but again it's still new. so give it some time.

4 words. stamina is a pain. it's the thing i hate the most. but i understand a game this size needs limits

-pros- 

the combat is great and the game makes you actually try when in combat instead of swinging a sword like a pickaxe to a enemy. the spells fell well controlled and your main weapon fells straight to the point

cooking is something i didn't expect a mmo to get right but this one sure did. when cooking you get something called a cooking station to which has a frying, pots and a knife to which you all interact with to cut boil fry mix to make different dish's

the world is massive honestly you could just buy the game for 15 just for the world. it has average graphics with a carton ish style that just the world pop in color

and which such a larger world you gotta have a good way to get around and so ramin provided. with guilding and climbing it makes transversal non annoying when having to go back to turn a quest in. it works great with ziplines and gliding points just makes life better

 -conclusion-
but overall what i wanted to touch on was the fact this game is still developing like i said it's barely a mmo but it's one hell of a start. if the devs keep there promises on what their adding then this game maybe just take top spot over bear saber. i just wanted you to know what your getting into but please watch videos on it before you buy. you won't spoil it just watch criticism videos and they will show and tell you the main problems with the game. other then thanks for reading

my opinion-
 you should buy it. if you don't like it now you will like it later. if your into mmo and rpgs",1643689140,5, ,283518

natural locomotion is a must have tool for any vr enthusiast. one of the main flaws with vr games is the variance in movement controls. game a might have a sophisticated arm swing style movement system but game b only has joystick movement. natural locomotion evens the playing field and gives you access to a universal movement system either using arm swing movement or joycon leg trackers which i would personally recommend. for maximum immersion and a good bit of exercise.,1595363222,0,0,705241

"this game is a little gem. 
borrowed it and played the whole campaign before, i saw they released smoke and thunder and had to get it.
all the updates that could be dlcs are included, so it keeps updating and you keep getting more campaigns. also comes with an arcade mode with more levels.

the soundtrack is out of this world. i actually listen to it when i'm playing other games.
the aesthetics of this game is so unique and dynamic, the game breathes with every beat and every shoot you take. it's minimal and super refined, with very high contrast and some worlds that are very spooky and original.

it's highly customizable, from how your weapons looks and the sound it makes, 
to how the enemies behave. you can have enemies that won't shoot you (if you are too lazy to dodge?) or not being able to shoot yourself and go pistol whip on everybody (so you just dodge like a mf) 

smoke and thunder alone took me around 80 minutes apparently on normal, so it's a short new campaign. 
so worth it. 
this game is a must have.

"this game met expectations then went a step further and exceeded them. the environment is gorgeous, the movement of the blocks is fluid and perfect. the only downside, and i hope there's a feature for this, is that there isn't really a way to calibrate it like rock band. when i first started playing i felt like i was hitting the blocks with my hands rather than the middle of the sabers. this is really nitpicky, as i got used to it and had an absolute blast. 10/10, 5/7, certified fresh, this game is what vr has been waiting for.",1525424317,0,0,649760

"apex construct is a pretty bland game in all regards. featuring a bare bones, poorly written, narrative and incredibly basic gameplay. the only thing this game really has going for it is the fact that it's a vr game.

if you're new to vr and this game is on sale, maybe consider picking it up. it could serve as an effective first experience to get comfortable with vr gameplay. though i would recommend titles like beat saber and superhot vr over apex construct to those in that position.

however, if you've had a vr system for a while and are fairly comfortable with it i'd avoid this game. there are much better titles available for oculus that do what apex construct tries to do to a much higher degree of success.",1610853814,5,"We are sad to hear you found Apex Construct to be bland, but we appreciate you taking the time to submit your feedback!

"disclaimer: got it in the indiegala bundle. had i bought it for full price it would be refund material and a much worse review.

played on oculus rift. launched both in vanilla steam vr and oculus mode.

the game is barely passable on presentation; the usual engrish menu and the lawnmower man laser aesthetic 80% of vr games go for, but it's functional for what it has to do. there seems to be a decent amount of content between the readily available songs and unlockables.

problem is, after ten minutes it's already clear i'm not going to bother, for one simple reason: the song charting is terrible. if you call your game a rhythm game (it's in the damn title!), i expect to play following the rhythm of the song. except the notes here are all over the place, the charts looks made from someone with no sense of music at all (if you played custom songs on beat saber or stepmania or whatever, think of the terrible ones).
so no, flailing my arms following only visual cues ain't my idea of a good time.",1569073871,3,0,701276

"so i've played through the game twice now, once on normal mode, and the second time on hard mode carrying some dumb ass gnome. i'll never have that experience to play through the game again for the first time, and going through it the second time i started to notice some problems.
let me preface the gripes i have with a solid recommendation: it's really really good.

the main gripe i have with the game is after you've mastered the gameplay, the game becomes easy. really really easy. let me give a breakdown of each main enemy and i'll explain.

barnacles: you just shoot them. if they are ever in a spot you can't shoot them there's usually an item nearby to force grab. most of the time you aren't just teleporting/moving around willy nilly so you'll basically never accidentally run into them.

headcrabs: they take a bit of time to jump on you, and once they do you can simply move out of the way or block them with a grabbed object.

poison headcrabs: while they are more tanky than their plain brethren, they still have the main issue where they take too long to attack and can be dodged. the poison effect they give goes away very quickly as well and from what i can tell don't drop your hp to 1 like in half-life 2.

armored headcrabs: these guys are more interesting to deal with when they are on a zombie, as they will need more shots to take down, but once they are on the ground and you have either a. good aim b. a laser sight upgrade or c. decent reflexes, they die in one shot from the pistol, even on hard. 

zombies: they move slowly enough that in most cases you can simply walk away.

reviver: this enemies mechanics are awesome, but once it's in a zombie the projectile the zombie creates is so slow it's almost pitiful, and the entire encounter boils down to ""don't go near it, wait for the electric pulses.""

antlions: super intimidating but will rarely ever hit you since they move slowly, won't jump at you like in half-life 2, and attack really slowly.

projectile antlion: this is a cool enemy, but every time you fight them there's a convenient place to hide from their attack.

manhack: due to the excellent sound design and the fact that shotguns exist, these guys will probably never sneak up on you and die even on hard with one shotgun blast.

combine: these guys aren't pushovers, which in my opinion makes them the best enemy types in the game. the heavies with their giant footsteps, shield, and overall tankiness are a blast to deal with. the minigun combine are a bit bland, as once you hear them rev (thanks sound design, we don't deserve you), it's simply a matter of waiting for them to stop, then peeking out and shooting them. the ai overall for the combine is excellent, with their flanking, going for cover when shot, and overall intelligence when spotting you.

with that said, this game is amazing, and going through the first time not completely familiar with the mechanics these gripes don't really apply. but on second playthrough, and even on hard, the game just felt easy. i hope somebody creates a mod to make enemies attack and move faster.

jeff: ""i hate you jeff"" sums it up pretty well. most terrifying enemy of them all, but once you realize as long as you cover your mouth or have a respirator and know how to throw bottles, he'll never kill you. the only time he killed me was when i was trying to get the near-jeff experience achievement (which i think is bugged) and i slapped his back after standing right next to him for over a minute. he immediately turned around and murdered me.",1585271421,3,0,554335

"quite honestly my favorite vr game to date. i intended to play it for a bit and spent 4.7 hours in it my first time. the longest i've spent in vr in one session since skyrim. 

i found myself using up 20-30 minutes just lifting various heavy objects into place at one point in an attempt to get into a hidden area. it didn't pan out but it was incredibly rewarding to look at all of the work i had done and feel like i actually accomplished something. i have had several moments like this where i would take my time and master that area and learn all i could about it before moving on. 

i had one bug where i tried a lever one too many times and it got stuck and had to reload the checkpoint (beginning of the area, there are no save spots), but having mastered the area i breezed through all of it to get back upto the same point in minutes. that is when i realized the game was feeling second nature for me and i was comfortable enough to do cool tricks.

"a very emotional visit to the past on a magnificient ship with it's crew. don't worry, they will fire those big cannons at the end and you will be able to explore the giant middle structure. 

you begin by actually reaching the ship by boat and you will leave by this very smaller boat. when you arrive, you are greated by the captain and men in full uniform and they will play the trumpet for you. 

everywhere you go, you talk to people and they explain everything in minute details. the people also perform small voiced demonstrations and the equipements actually works. there are maps and sign to indicate where you are and where you should go. you can explore in a limited manner at first, but as you explore more and more, more places will be available. i think they did that so you would not get too much lost. the ship is big and it took me 2.2 hours to make the tour. 

to trigger the ending, you must go talk to the captain in his private dining room (after visiting everything), then return to the deck.

the thing that is hard to describe is the feeling, this living museum feels real. the las conversation with the captain before leaving was very emotional. they talk like they would when they were alive. in the back of your mind, you know that they will all die soon. and when you leave by boat, they all salute you. the ocean of feelings man (i had tears in my eyes).

it is totally worth the price 35$cdn, but it would reach a wider audience at 15-20$. on a technical side, it is 98% perfec, with some windows missing on the right side of the ship and some holes into the ground, but they are not noticable unless you are looking for it. the engine sound in the room where the guys are eating is only playing in either the left or right ear, but rarely both. that is very unpleasant and immersion breaking. the engrish is good enough to understand the meaning and it is somewhat realistic, because they speek japanes and it is translated to you.

"the realest rundown , short sweet and in depth 

- no story yet
- aim is on point 
- levels that are dark are dark so its hard to see 
- character ""runs"" so damn slow and theres no dedicated button to make him go any faster 
- sandbox modes are alright . good to showcase what ai does, how wepons work

heres the big flaws an hour in . 

any shooter you play the most important is precision aiming and loading a gun. the devs nailed the aim but loading a gun is an absolute nightmare . the hand gun is alright . one of the easier ones . cocking the hammer back is a nightmare . oculus 2 controller feel like their in a un-natural position . clips for smg's are a pain . not so much the mp5 but the other ones are a pain . the actual grabbing of the clip from the ammo pouch is buggy . shot gun amo is pretty fluent tho so if youre gonna play, stick with the handgun and shotgun . 

as of now , its far from perfect. sadly i wont be playing this again until theres some major updates 

but!!!!! 

the potential for a gory shooter that makes you feel like a menace is here and im actually really excited to see where it goes 

would i recomend as of right now?! no . in the future? absolutely if the devs clean this up.",1671352098,0,,128779787

"i have played countless vr titles and i just do not find this game fun to play. the trailers are great but trailers are a showcase of the best moments in game right after the other. in reality this game is not anywhere as fun to play. it is a slow boring slog.

it is long and tedious without much going on. you can see they went for the half-life and portal style. the atmosphere seems like portal behind the scenes test environment and it has a heavy reliance on models taken from half-life like crates and crowbar and many ideas stolen from those series. like a headcrab that is now a virtual headcrab but looks like a combine. turrets utilized like in portal and hl. and while these are cool aspects the game itself lacks in delivering them. 

they chose realistic full body physics in this game. what that means is nausea. now i own htc vive and psvr. i can be in vr for hours without nausea and i absolutely enjoy superhot, asgard's wrath (played and beaten in revive), gorn, raw data, wildlands, lightblade and beat saber, farpoint and that other system shock rogue like game on psvr, although i have played many many more. and never do i suffer from nausea in any of them no matter for how long i play. 

this game will give you nausea because full body physics in vr like in blade and sorcery are a bad idea. because in order not to feel nausea your body must be fooled that it is going where the eye sees. it is the reason why you can get nausea from playing seated and not moving or if you fall down in vr because you are actually not falling and the brain doesn't get why. with full body physics your hands and body and head will not move through objects and walls. while it seems cool on paper it is a bad design choice for vr game because you will often find yourself stuck due to or impaled on an object. you real body and eye coordination will expect you to have moved forward but the game doesn't let you making you feel nausea. in many games you can go through walls because of that and peek through doors etc. here you cannot do that but if you accidentally run into a wall prepare for nausea to start building up over time. and there are just so many objects to get stuck on that you will constantly fool your eyes and brain and will end up feeling bad over time. other games do not have these physics that is why they do not give nausea even if you fly like spiderman in wildlands. 

i suggest superhot isntead of this, and asgards' wrath which are work on htc vive with revive and work very good. also stormland. if you are looking for non vr experience play original half-life with brutal mod or portal series. 

this game is pretty bad, i regret buying it but it is too late to refund as it has been more than 14 days and i got winter sale steam rewards for it.

"while this is a cheapie, i cannot recommend this game for a few reasons:

1. index controllers are broken. you cannot interact with the bow for example. i managed to use the vive wands with no obvious issues, but index is supposed to be supported based on the store page. a lot of recent releases have had issues with index controllers, and i think this is a problem with unity's xr system or the steam vr plugin for unity. regardless, if you advertise support for hardware, you better expect reviews to complain when that hardware isn't actually working with your software.

2. visuals aren't very pleasing. the roller coaster cart is pretty basic. you start already in it, which is usual practice for these kinds of experiences, but i would have liked to be able to ""get in"" and ""get out"" in some way. the scaling is all wrong, especially in the spaceship level. it would be nice if the cart-related stuff was expanded upon and improved since there isn't much to look at in the distance (draw distance is extremely short in most scenes, space scene is nicer quality but less interesting overall). animations are basic and dinosaurs feel like they were cheap assets just thrown onto a plane and left alone. i would have liked to see a dinosaur actually interact with the ride. the pterodactyl could have lifted the cart over a gap for example. i've seen this done right a couple times, and i had hopes to see it done right here.

3. tracks are not smooth enough to keep the immersion. there are many moments in each ride which just feel like you're jerked sideways in some unrealistic fashion. it would be an easy issue to fix by just adjusting the bezier curve of the track, which makes me wonder if any playtesting was done before release.

at $3 non-sale price, i wasn't expecting much, but this feels like it could be easily improved, and there's no real reason to buy this at this time. if you're looking for a good roller coaster experience that's interactive and feels like a game, check out ghost town mine ride & shootin' gallery, which is not much more expensive ($8) and is available for free on viveport infinity if you have an active membership. i will update this review if/when the game improves, and i wish the developer luck with future updates as well as future releases.

"another ""i wish steam had a mixed review"" review. bonelab's campaign is pretty bare bones. there simply isn't really that much content in the campaign. it took me about 6 hours to complete, which isn't actually bad. my issue isn't with the runtime, but rather the content. pretty much 60% of the levels are tutorials, and once you unlock all the bodies you get to use them for like all of 2 levels. then that's the end. the reason i am giving this a thumbs up however is that the base system is pretty damn good. the physics feel great just like boneworks, and they have added quite a bit of cool sandboxy things. the combat feels good, and the new weapons are great. i just don't understand how they can justify having a campaign like they have it. this game leans far heavier into the puzzle territory than boneworks, sometimes for better sometimes for worse. the minigames are pretty good too from what i have experienced. also i cannot understand why they would give the gokart to the player after the moonlevel. would have made it such a better experience.

there is a fix for this already in the game.

if you hate sitting still to game and have a taste for rhythm stuff, play this game. if you want to be a potato, this may not be your taste.

best of all, it's not trying to simulate anything, which makes it much more believable at this stage of vr evolution. it uses the technology as it currently exists to great effect. oh yeah, no motion sickness either.

"this is a really great way of interacting with desktop apps while in vr, and is a lot easier than pressing the menu button and using the desktop option on the steamvr toolbar (which doesn't even have a windows button on the keyboard!)
although, it isn't without its faults. for one, the ui/ux could use some work. often times when i hide my windows, walk somewhere else in my room, then show my windows again, they're all the way on the other side of the room. this can be fixed by enabling window recentering, but you have to do this for every single window, and it often causes windows to be slightly tilted or in odd positions after you re-enable your windows and they recenter themselves. even better is that you have to hold down the grip button for a little before a window cooperates and moves. you would think that being in 'edit' mode would allow me to instantly move windows around since i'm, you know, editing them? which brings me into my next big gripe: edit mode.
edit mode just isn't a very intuitive concept. basically, if you want to create new windows or move them, you must be in edit mode. however, if you disable edit mode, your windows still exist in your space, you just can't move them. this might not seem like a huge issue, but it can be very confusing when you go to grab a window and it refuses to move. i often found myself trying to move a window, catching myself, then enabling edit mode. theoretically, this issue could be solved if you were always in 'edit' mode when your windows is visible, which is kind-of similar to what xsoverlay does. the only issue with this is that the little controls under each window are [b] always [/b] visible, which can clutter/block your vision. i think that if the controls under window were hidden if your pointer is far away from them, that would largely solve a lot of my issues with edit mode. that, and explaining what edit mode is/does in the tutorial since it wasn't very clear on why i had to enable it in the first place.
the biggest usability issue for me is the resizing gesture. there's no other way to say it: it's a disaster. in order to resize a window, you must grab both grip buttons and move your controllers further apart or closer together. on paper, this seems intuitive enough, but in practice the gesture is very delayed and feels clumsy. the tutorial also had me under the impression that i had to have both of my pointers on the left and right side window before i could resize windows, but i found out on accident that this isn't actually the case. i would often find myself making a window massive, only to over-correct and make it tiny again. eventually, it would become so frustrating i would instead opt to press the resize buttons under a window instead.
there's also workshop support for this tool, but yet there's no support for custom watches, which i think is a huge missed opportunity. the current watch is a little ugly, and it would be awesome if the community could create and submit their own watches/watch overlays.
overall, i think that this is a fairly well made and somewhat intuitive way of interacting with your desktop in vr. while there are a lot of improvements to be made, especially in the ui/ux department, it's a lot better than dealing with oculus's or steamvr's desktop implementation, both of which are awful. the best feature at least for me is being able to look at the time easily in vr. when playing in vr for the first time, i couldn't break the habit of looking at my wrist to see the time, so i'm glad this is a suitable replacement. i guess the window overlays are a nice bonus :p",1700865942,0,,151699860

"i just want to start with a big thank you to the team that made this game possible.

the game sets you in the shoes of a young lad in the mid 90's who has a deep love for video games.
each level presenting a different game style and ""in life"" challenges to deal with.
it is a sit/stand still playable game so the comfort levels are great for players new to vr but there is never a dull moment.
it is a story driven game that is also filled with challenges and trophies to keep you coming back for a second time.
i don't want to say too much about the difference game styles or levels as to me, part of the fun was finding out and being taken back to a time when i use to play nintento while my mum kept telling me to turn it off..",1614482614,5,"We are glad to hear.

"just finished playing through and after years of waiting for more half life, we got a great new addition to the series. half life has always been a hallmark of innovation in computer gaming, and alyx is no exception. a bold adventure with top notch technological innovation this game doesn't hold back on anything. and after finishing i'm ready to play it all through again.

there are some minor hiccups and there's a bit of a learning curve, but valve really did an amazing job of optimizing the game so that you can have just about the smoothest game play experience possible. the gravity gloves in particular are a phenomenal choice for the game so that everything you need is never out of reach and are a blast to use. 

my only real issue using the game was that some times there would be a major frame rate drop and i would get an effect where my head movements would be incremental, flashing forward a few frames at a time. this issue would sometimes resolve itself, but a system restart resolved the issue for a more long term solution. also sometimes the loading screens would make the lenses flash individually which cause significant eye strain. i'm unsure if this issue was caused by my pc hardware, the headset itself, or the game, but this really only happened a few times and was fixable by restarting the software or a hard reboot if the issue persisted and was an otherwise smooth game play experience.

as a whole, this is a phenomenal game, it's exactly what i was hoping for and an excellent continuation that the fans had been waiting for, for so long. this is a benchmark for vr gaming, and i would love for more half life adventure like this going forward.",1601166452,3,0,539344

"the absolute best as far as vr comes. if you have a vr headset, this is the game to get even if you don't like half life as a series
i usually don't pre-order games for obvious reasons but when i heard that they were releasing a new half life game not only did i pre-order it but i also  wenjt ahead and bought a vr headset (which was something that was unsure if i should buy or not)
i came in here with my expectation kinda low just so that i wouldn't have been let down if it turned out it was just a sellout move from valve but boy oh boy did they deliver.
the story alone is amazing and as a half life fan i'm super stoked and excited for what's to come in the next years for this franchise.
but the gameplay and the mechanics are out of this world. before this game the most daring was boneworks for the amount of interactivity with the physics in that game. and sure it's incredible what they did with it but from my perspective it was a bit too much. climbing for example is the most frustrating thing in the world and i still haven't finished the story for that final ladder at the end of the game. but in hl:a it's as easy as grabbing the ladder and pulling yourself up. if you wanted you could do just one movement upward and the game would climb it for you if that's your thing.
i had never been more pleased with a purchase as i have been with my headset and this game.

personally, i think the mounted weapons are some of the best parts of the game. finding a mounted weapon on a defensible position or on a vehicle feels great. every single gun in this game feels good to use and very intuitive, with a helpful highlight feature incase you dont understand the gun in real life. my only issue is that some guns dont hold the bolt open after youre empty. i dont know for sure that all guns hold the bolt open after the last shot but i do know the sa80 should.",1611766944,0,0,734609

the add-on music packs are extremely overpriced, often low effort in the mapping.

although we did not talk, he was instantly my best friend and i miss him so much already. this game is just pure unadulterated fun with other players, i wish more people would play this game. none of my friends have vr or this game, unfortunately.

even though this game is dead, and with no players even with cross-play on. i highly recommend this game if you have someone to play with. this game is more of an arcade on-rail shooter where you move from sections to sections, but how you approach those sections is entirely up to you, since you are still able to freely roam around. an example being, you can wield akimbo smgs with one-handed reload and just walk up to enemies and unload dps into their heads.",1728098557,0,,176390911

i played seated as my playing space is really limited, and it all played really well.  all the controls are extremely intuitive and didnt suffer from any motion sickness, other than the initial few hours which were most probably due to me getting used to vr itself on the rift.
for those hoping for a non-vr mod for this.... i really cant see it working.  this game is built for vr and it really needs to be experienced in vr to fathom how good it is.  valve should be given a lot of credit for this.  let's hope with all the legwork already being done with regards to the engine and vr interface, we can expect another hl game some time in the near future, and not in 10+ years time.",1586166052,3,0,548456

everything about this game is very fun and unique but one of the things to catch my eye was the shockingly realistic handling of the weapons. you can manually pull back the hammer ahead of time on the revolver for a shorter trigger press and you can even decock it if you wish. it's very rare to see vr games with realistic gun mechanics and the ability to use them in the same ways a real firearm could be used so it's super refreshing and awesome to see it used in such a creatively unique game.,1645985580,5, ,352267

in practical terms the time spent on the treasure hunt section would have been better used to provide much deeper educational content. if people want to play a game on their vive, this isn't going to be the title they reach for - so why spend time and resource developing it? the flashlight is too dim, making it very hard to get an idea of the full grandeur of the room you're stood in. i'd like to see higher quality textures and many more items added to the tomb.",1460808730,3,0,481085

survios make high quality vr titles and they haven't disapointed. the game mechanics work great, visuals and audio are awesome. this is definately an arcade boxing title for the masses. for a more extensive boxing workout to break yourself to exhaustion then the spit and sawdust 'thrill of the fight' is the better choice.

also, i'll readily admit that i didn't play long enough to determine if things get better, but quite frankly, i very much suspect that from 15 minutes to 15 hours, it won't look any better and gameplay won't change that much.  this isn't to say that it is a bad game either, just not a game for me.",1702258663,0,,153343302

"after a full month of using this app, from monday to friday i can tell you:
- the lack of music in a rhythm based workout it makes me lose motivation so quickly. (example: five to six different workout routines i've done, from 15 to 45 minutes the ""victorious"" song is there...and it's soooooo bad). 
- one song always will have the exact same routine, so it becomes monotonous. (and it makes me doubt about your ""professional personal trainers"")
- the extreme pack it's way to far from extreme, there's some ""free songs"" more extreme than those. put that money in the game thrill of the fight, it would last way more than this dlc.
i will keep this review in 2 stars, because of the cost of this app and the dlc compared to my benefits. i can go up if i see any changes in the normal version, because i will no put more money on dlc's.

My name¡¯s Tom, I¡¯m one of the newer Customer Experience Managers at FitXR.

I just wanted to come back to this review to let you know about some of the changes we¡¯ve recently introduced to the app. I completely understand if you¡¯re no longer interested in using FitXR - but a lot has changed lately, and we¡¯ve been trying hard to listen and learn from the feedback of our community.

We know we handled the transition to membership poorly, and we really are sorry for the dissatisfaction caused; we¡¯ve now altered the Home Screen for any Legacy customers, so that membership is no longer the primary focus - though it¡¯s available through the Account section of the app in case you wanted to expand your library of content.

In addition to that, all previously available DLC add-on packs have now been released for free to all Legacy users - and we¡¯re also adding in one extra free class every month from our brand new classes, so that there¡¯s something fresh to look forward to; and so you can see how the quality of content is improving over time.

Again, totally respect if the app is no longer for you, or you¡¯ve found an alternative provider, but I just wanted to reach out and let you know that we¡¯re trying to make things better - and a lot of our former users have agreed the changes have been a step in the right direction.

Best,

and know we have so many things to do! new turrets (especially turret bulding system, that's awesome!), new spuds, new maps and it's really fun to play with your friends or your children.
it's still in early access, so of course we will se some bugs here or there. but devs are in touch with players, so it's ok.

update: 30.07
for the people who give bad reviews after less then 10h playtime and complain about getting stomped - none of you were good in any game you didnt spend time in. 
look in the settings and change snap turn > smooth turn and use v stock type 1 or 2.
this will help with aiming - just putting a little time into practicing and learning how to aim and learning the maps will help a lot in having fun.
it is a social game, so ask people who are better at it for advice - especially the esports players and content creators are very helpful, even if it seems like they are sweating every game. 

also!
-competitive and casual queues are confirmed to be added.
-there are much more players playing from quest standalone than on pcvr/steam (dw its all crossplay)",1712018861,0,,161991138

one note on the video quality, since some have criticized it:
the quality of the video in this  is a great deal better than any other 360 video i've seen (i'm running with a 1080ti). and it is actual 360 video, rather than panoramic. that said, due to 1st gen hmd resolutions. as well as compression limitations, we're not going to completely ""feel like we're there"" for  a while yet, but this is as close as it comes at present. the dev seems to have done everything on their end to push the best video for the consumer product we currently have. the results are impressive, and i look forward to more. i think i saw a ""great courses"" logo in there somewhere. hopefully that means that the company is looking into doing more of this. once again: this is what vr is for. i've seen dozens of games where you shoot stuff, and, in the end, it all goes boom. i've only seen a couple of experiences like this, and this is the best one yet.",1516418614,5,"Hi Cullinarn,

Thank you so much for your awesome review! We worked really hard to provide an experience that captured the feeling of being on a Smithsonian Journeys tour with an expert guide. It makes us really happy to see that you enjoyed it. 
The production was a joint effort between Smithsonian Journeys, The Great Courses, Total Cinema 360, Lucid Dream VR and a LOT of generous help from Oculus, whom we cannot possibly thank enough.
We were worried about the file sizes of the videos (I think it comes in at some 20 GB) but we were really laser-focused on providing a LOT of really interesting content for our audience. We're really happy with the video quality as well, especially for the run and gun conditions we were under - you can't exactly shut down the Piazza San Marco for two days in June. :)

"tl/dr: i have a quest 3. exceptionally fun, particularly for a massive 40k nerd but setting knowledge is not a requirement. but if you do have that knowledge, the scale and tone is captured very well. a little buggy, a little unreliable (i had a couple of crashes), and the checkpoints could be more frequent. well worth the money i spent on it, though probably not worth getting a full vr setup specifically to play this game.

the bad (i'm just getting it out of the way first, the good far far outweighs it):
the worst part of this game is that the checkpoints are not frequent enough. in a vr game, checkpoints should be very frequent, in case people need a break for eyestrain or nausea (i was mostly eyestrain). i could go 15-20 minutes without a new one, and when my head was pounding and i had gone 10 minutes past a checkpoint and i was just begging for another one, it got a little tiring.
buggy. if i ever set down the controllers, the game stopped tracking them until i closed it down and restarted it. made streaming it for an interested friend a nightmare. also i had my share of crashes, no more than 3 or 4 though, and usually while trying to get it to stream effectively.
40k fans: power scaling is not lore accurate in the slightest, which is a positive for me, but could be a negative for others. more on that in ""the good""

the good:
hack and slash/shooter fans: 
the gunplay, once you get a feel for the aiming, is very fun. the guns are nice and weighty, yes they have easy reload, but you can also manually reload which can be very satisfying. i'm not sure how the throwing physics work with grenades but i'm sure with enough practice i could get better at it. you can carry up to 4 weapons, two on either hip, two on either shoulder, and a big part of it is managing your space to customize your loadout. swords can only go over your shoulder, pistols can only go on your hips, two handed guns, either/or. i personally found it very fun to carry a sword and pistol, a long range weapon of some kind and a short range weapon like the meltagun (think super shotgun). each weapon has its place and purpose, and i found quite a few weapons combos that i really liked. my personal favorite was two plasma pistols, a bolter, and a power sword.
swords can get caught on things, the game had a bad habit of not registering my swings, but part of that was me so i don't hold it against the game. swords are very useful for protecting yourself and tend to do more damage than your guns.

40k fans:
it captures the scale very well. when you meet a black templar, you find him using a bolter the size of your whole body, and you really get a feel for the size of a space marine. which is great because when i was fighting the word bearers and a marine came flying at me on a jump pack brandishing twin lightning claws, i suddenly and viscerally understood the concept of transhuman dread and needed a change of pants. the cathedrals are big, you get to see an imperial knight up close, that's huge, it just does the size of 40k justice.
the power scaling is very ""rule of cool,"" which is a positive for me, might be a negative for others. it's a game first and a 40k lore product second. the level design is great, the enemies are varied and placed with deliberate care to create a fun challenge, and the boss fights have some fun and creative mechanics. and while a lone sister of battle would never be able to 1v1 an astartes terminator, you are a named sister of battle, and as we all know, a name is the most powerful thing in the entire setting. so you actually fight and defeat a fair few of them. 

the neutral:
some of the fights can be a bit much. then again, might just be a skill issue on my part lol. it's a tough game in my experience, and there were a couple of deaths that shouldn't have happened, but overall, it wasn't that bad, though this does cause a problem when you're dealing with the checkpoint issue i mentioned.
levels are about 45 minutes apiece if you're not bad like me, which may be a little long for a vr session, but that's a person by person basis.
faith powers are a little too fiddly to use effectively without practice, but have some great utility once you get them down.

overall, wholehearted recommendation from me! it was at the point by the end where i would check the time and say ""oh come on, i have just enough time for one more mission before bed. just a few more heretics."" it's the kind of game that had me actively wishing i could play more, but not being able to because eyestrain.",1732502216,0,,179765971

no joke that's what this game is, if thats what you are looking for, than 100% worth the money, the game is full, its smooth, it has the ups and downs of skyrim, with all of the ups being multiplied by the mysticism of virtual reality. i, like many others, was hesitant about spending $60 on this game again, but you shouldn't be, because if you already own a vr headset, and you have played skyrim, or haven't but still thinks it looks cool, then this game is worth being in your library.

"such a great concept. i feel like these rube-goldberg machine concepts are very captivating for a lot of people. when i was a kid i used to watch this show called mcgee and me that had a marble rolling down a long track and falling into a cup (all that to sharpen your pencil, dude?) which for some reason i always thought was the coolest thing. well, now i get to pretend like i'm doing it for real. it's probably not as satisfying as setting something like that up irl, but there is a 100% reduced chance that my cats will knock it over at some point when constrained to vr.

super chill game with some very thought-provoking puzzles in the ""campaign"" mode. some of these are real head-scratchers, but i've never had one stump me for too long. i'm about halfway through the game so far (i think) and some of the puzzles have held me up long enough to make me really appreciate my labors when i finally complete them, but never enough to frustrate. they also give you way too many pieces per puzzle, but in a good way. you can do this as minimally and efficiently as possible, or you can solve puzzles by going crazy with all of your pieces and making something wacky, which really is the entire point of a rube-goldberg when you get right down to it.

there's also a sandbox mode which i haven't spent much time in, where you can setup your own overly-complex machines just for kicks.

that being said i have a 4-year-old son he plays this game nearly every day he loves it, my point being it might be out of his league but he's able to do it and that it that raises up my stars.

however the only reason i'm giving a four out of five and i hate to be that guy cuz you guys really deserve a five out of five and if it happens let me know because i probably won't be the one to know.


but four out of five because of one issue which is the hand tracking which was the sole purpose in me buying this for a 4-year-old does not work perfectly.

now to be honest that really doesn't feel like a fair thing to do... but sorry guys it's what i did and it's what i have to do it didn't look perfect when i was watching it didn't seem like he's enjoying it it's just a little bit not correct.

good job otherwise keep it up but i've seen better hand tracking in free apps which is a little bit discouraging for me.

but it seemed like it worked and if i get a dev's response guys i really wish there was an in-between here and i'm trying to tell you i would give you a 4.9 stars out of five in fact i would willingly raise mine to a five out of five if i knew you were working actively to improve the hand tracking but i have a feeling that this may go and get swept under the rug.",1611458614,5, ,183435

"the great thing about the vr version of this game is that the vive controls are excellent.  it's flying finally done right.  essential flying actions - pitching up/down, acceleration (to any speed), boost, strafing left/right and up/down, going backwards, and rolling left / right can all be done seamlessly with one hand, and still with a bunch of buttons left over on that same hand.  if other games still struggle to figure out how to do it well, the shame is on them.

sadly, the game itself is a flop.  you'll get weapons, shields, engines, and missiles, but the selection is very limited, and they all feel rather similar.  you can get capital ships, but cannot fly them.  and they don't feel all that capital.  actually, they feel rather small.

in fact, considering you're in space, everything in the game feels oddly small.  ships, stations, battles, asteroids.  some asteroids are large (in fact, far larger than irregularly-shaped asteroids can physically get in real life), but those are always ""background"" ones - gigantic, non-rotating, frozen in place, and absolutely non-interactive.  they never really feel like they're part of the environment.

stations are weirdly empty.  when you dock and walk around the station, you'll generally find three or so people in there.  for the most part you'll find empty cafeterias, empty music clubs (with music playing and the audo of a crowd, but nobody actually there), and empty hallways.  when you run across someone, it will be one of game's several horribly modeled and abysmally animated characters that will immediately break any suspension of disbelief you may have about interacting.

but the worst thing about the game is the absolute lack of clear information on how to do things.  for instance, you can trade in this game - but doing that is about as fun and natural as dealing with the bureaucracy and legal guidelines of real-world business without any actual depth.  moreover, much of it is hidden behind wholly unintuitive peculiarities of the game's interface and rules that are not in any way spelled out, so you'll need to spend a lot of time searching through poorly done tutorials and gameplay videos on youtube in order to figure out how to even start doing any of it.  sometimes there is a weird side-scrolling timing mini-game involved that feels entirely out of place in the game.

if that were not enough, the game has a tendency to crash the vr headset.  if you (well, i) play the game for about 2 hours, the chances are pretty good that, at some point, the vr headset will go gray, and the game will need a reset.  i have tried doing things like running the game in full screen vs window, as well as changing graphics settings, but this issue seems there to stay.  none of my other vr games does this. 

x rebirth feels entirely unfinished.  but it has excellent vr flying controls.  i sincerely hope that they implement this game's controls in their other games, and nothing else.",1546123339,4,3,579964

"if you're a gun enthusiast and you have a vr headset, this game is for you, there's no going around that.

an impressive array of weapons, each and everyone of them simulated to the most minute detail, including each particular caliber with different ammo types. the ballistic are on point, with ricochets and bullet penetration that go as close as they can to reality.

the tightest gameplay of any vr title i've played.

and this is not just a shooting range simulator, the developer is astoundingly active and updates the game each week adding new content, improvements and gamemodes.

right now there's your standard realistic gun ranges (one of them a replica of hickock45 backyard), but also a modular range with many different challenges and unlock progression, a spooky terror gamemode, two modes where you take checkpoints inside a hostile compound, a roguelite open world zombie gamemode, a small open world parody of westworld, and and a coliseum with a couple of modes and difficulties (including free for all), global leaderboard included.

but there's a catch: all the enemies you'll be fighting are human sized sausages.

the developer is very clear about never making humanoid enemies. it might sound strange and unappealing at first but those guys are wonderfully programmed and are fun as hell to play against, as they physically react to everything you throw at them, all of it combined with a really intuitive armor system.

you can stab their ""faces"" with pencils, disarm them and them shoot them in the back. you can sneak behind them and snap their necks, or go full beast mode and crush their spine or rip them in half. that's the kind of cartoonish things that would be kind of difficult to pull off with more realistic enemies, but i understand how some people might not be too thrilled about it.

the biggest issue i think this game has is the lack of a proper tutorial about controls, there's many things like the remote grab and the multiple cartridge grab, or the different ways of locomotion (this game has one of the best armswinger controls) that are not really explained anywhere easily accesible, so a nice and extensive tutorial for beginners would be cool.

all in all, this is probably in my top 3 of vr games.",1544643217,3,0,473911

after playing just one hour of this game, i already like it.  to say much attention has been given to detail is an understatement.  it does take a little getting used to the controls and gameplay, but so far so good.  with what i've read of other reviews, i figure there's much much more to learn about and do in this game.  there also seems to be a loooong laundry list of achievements, which should keep anyone occupied for a while.
if i were to put a rating on this experience so far, its right up there with the likes of lone echo, robo recall, gunheart and stormland (all great aaa titles).  the polish on this title take the visuals to a whole other level and are very beautiful, from what i've seen so far.
transitioning to god-mode was a great experience and i hope i'm not wrong in saying that this title is the first to offer 2 perspectives in a single game while maintaining interaction with the environment/characters.

now several hours into the game and having gotten the hang of it, i am hooked.  this game keeps me coming back... and i like that i can take my time to fully explore every nook and cranny, which is rewarding on so many levels.  add to all this that there are also a plethora of side quests to keep things interesting.

"by the most despised player, 
i'm going to talk about why this game is bad, not good by pointing out its current flaws
(its still pretty good though)

how it runs..?
30 series graphics cards (like my 3070ti) struggles to run this game. that says a lot about it's optimization. 
netcode is horrific:
16ms to 30ms you can die behind walls/cover.
(players at lan traded a few times)  
peekers advantage is unbelievable and has created a meta in the game of waiting for audio, preaiming and being able to fire 3-5 shots before the enemy can even see you.

maps are terribly made, and are all ct sided, the only good map is suna- why? because its a copy of dust 2.
it is also very difficult to know if someone is above or below you with audio. 

the devs hold the player natix as their mascot and have contributed a lot of money towards him and teammates in order to give a competitive advantage over other teams.
but i wont overlook the fact that natix has put in a lot of work to be a good player. (im better)
the lan was a great experience for me and i loved the opportunity but about 60% of people in the crowd didn't know what was going on and were all media influencers (maybe paid to be there) - being a player there; i had someone ask me if i could see players through walls like the casters can.

the game is very slowly getting better, and i mean slowly. weekly updates are great but they seem so focused on adding new things to try keep people interested in the game. 
thank you aex for listening to the community and communicating with everyone i do respect it.

i'm still going to play this game, it can be fun and i have nothing better to do in my day. and i believe it can become the best comp vr shooter out there.

i play mostly on expert+ and i love the fluidity of the game, rapid fire movement and intense music pounding through my little oculus speakers but it also has a casual side to it that many people enjoy, yes i dare say beat saber is the guitar hero of vr.
modding has been a touchy subject but i see that as pretty silly, anybody within the modding scene knows that updates will often break mods, whether you are modding a bethesda game , beat saber or payday its all the same. people should expect that especially for an early access game where code is constantly changing.
the dlc thing is real scummy though especially when the game lacks content without the almost mandatory song browser.
devs need to work on multiplayer content and more high quality original maps, especially with an asking  price of 20$ here in the states.

"it feels like playing as the gdi commando from c&c 3!

this game game certainly is a hidden gem. it is kind of tower defence + rts + fps. 
the story/theme is basically on the likes of starship troopers.

the good:
*weapons feels good and powerful. enemies are not bullet sponges (besides the higher level ones).
*the vehicles (a mech and a flying gunship for now) certainly adds a lot of fun.
*map editor so you can build your own missions.
*campaign that can be played singleplayer or co-op.
*level system where you can unlock new weapons and upgrades over time.

the bad things:
*braindead ai. to be honest, i don't think there is an ai at all. the enemy will literally dance in front of your allied turrets/robots and they will just stay there looking. sometimes they shoot back, but most of the time they are quite useless. (they will also often miss when they decide to shoot back, because they can't account for the enemy movement).

*turrets only targets enemy in a 180?? in front of them for some reason. they are turrets for fuck sake. they are supposed to turn 360??...

*if it wasn't for the dumb ai already, the campaign maps seems to be purposely designed to make the allied units as useless as possible. on most of the maps, you units can't follow you properly because there is some kind of obstacle they can't cross between point a and b. sometimes you can't even cross those obstacles while personally driving your mech (but you can go through on foot).

*hitboxes are horrible. sometimes the enemy gets inside your base (the teleport you have to deffend). they can damage it, but you cant shoot them back, even having a clear line of sight. rocks and trees seems to have an invisible hitbox that is as big as a house.

all i hope is they fix some of the bugs mentioned above (specially the hitboxes and the ai). i also hope they add mod support so we can add new vehicles, weapons, enemies, etc (we can already create our own maps, so why not modding new units into the game?).

"without mods - negative
with mods - positive

skyrim vr is a mixed bag but overall can be an amazing experience.... but because the engine and graphics are quite dated its not the best or even top 3 vr games i played. experiencing the elder scrolls in 3d is still a great gaming moment. if you have a pc able to crank up the detail and scaling you'll have a great time i cannot really recommend for lower or mid range vr users unless you're happy with some blurred visuals and a bit of clunkiness. 

the key to making this game work properly and to make the gameplay experience enjoyable you need mods from nexus mods. there are 10-15 essential mods that boost graphics, improve ui and controls and add lots of nice things like bigger better cities or just general bug fixes. these are easy to find on google! you can clearly see bethedsa have given the community the bare basic working game knowing they would mod and improve it.

skyrim vr game can be played seated or room scale. for the best experience room scale all the way however seated is how i play 80% of the time and it took a bit of tweaking. you'll need to make sure you have space between you and your desk for seated if you wish to use wand controllers as weapons and shields require manual swinging and parrying. that said the game still looks and feels great with a controller and both xbox and ps ones work fine. the major negative is even 2 years later there is no keyboard and mouse support nor has anyone modded this.

if you're going to buy and play this game accept you'll need to mod and tweak it. other than that it's still the great skyrim rpg experience you'd expect but being able to look over mountain tops or feel the immersion in caves and dungeons is excellent.

"was looking forward to this for the longest time, and this game really does deliver. :) granted, there might not be as much ""meat"" on it as the original adventure games had, but it's still an excellent piece to add to the collection for those who love sam and max (as i do!).

however, i am experiencing a bug where the game randomly freezes the image and must be restarted (basically a crash, except i can still hear audio continuing and presumably ""move around"" though i'm unable to see it).  i'm guessing that the app simply needs some bug fixes and updates, since it's so new, so developers, if you're reading this, please look into this and fix it!  the autosave function definitely helps with continuing where i left off, but it seems to be happening a bit more often, and i am concerned.

non-fans of sam and max might not get much out of this, but i thoroughly enjoy it.  writing and voice acting are top notch, music is awesome, and interactivity/immersion is fun!  i do kind of wish sam and max would ""react"" if you touched them, but that's just an incentive, as opposed to a ""need"". :)

"to those who are wandering through the negative reviews.
this game has been 'dead' for quite a while now and has less than (on average) 300~ people playing
this has been the case for a while now due to the devs killing the modding scene
the game will feel very empty if you decide to play
additionally, as an insult the devs put in microtransactions as if that's gonna bring anybody into the game

you should have played this game around 3 to 2 years ago as the community and modding scene was much more alive.
it is not worth playing today as the game feels empty and hollow with the lack of players and the lack of modded maps.
to all my fellas that i played with before the nuking of mods it was fun playing with stupid maps like tornado time and (forgot the name but it involves one team trying to kill the other team with trucks,clowns involved :d )
however due to the nuking of mods, many fun and goofy game mods are simply not available to play because the devs of the mods didnt bother to fix them or werent able to fix them to the new standards
im afraid we wont ever be able to experience the goofy fun of those stupid maps ever again, as the newest update shows how little the devs care about modding features and instead want to milk the game dry as much as possible before the playerbase completely dies out

"this game saved my life.

i am 27.

my ex-wife and i have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. they are now both 4 years old.

when we were going through our separation, i found myself lost and miserable. i was self destructive. i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with.. the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide.

after learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, i was borderline suicidal. keep in mind that just a few months before this, i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. i have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

having nothing better to do, i searched for a game i could play, one handed while i recovered. i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. i decided that it had to be worth a shot... i must admit, i didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. in fact, i may have only played this game a day or two.. with that being said, after doing so, i had a new found joy and hope for life. i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. i was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". i relaxed for 5 ??????? minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay.

after coming to that realization, i turned the game off, and i went back to work. it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated. i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and i became the father i needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy i was behaving as.

today, i am close friend with my kids mother. we don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. we are parents, and friends.

i now have 3 kids. my third child is, wait for it, also 4 years old. the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. we have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, i wouldn't be where i am today. this silly little game helped me realize that.

exploring, crafting, persistent world, survival -- with decent gun, melee, and rig mechanics; this would be great;  except the game has a day/night cycle, wherein you can only explore during the day -- and that day is limited arbitrarily by a short timer before 'bells' sound off, making the whole experience rushed.

"[h1]experienced on the oculus rift. spoiler-free review.[/h1]

you can view my spoiler-free review here: https://youtu.be/z95hogwu7qy

this is a 10 minute long, seated, cinematic horror experience running on the unreal engine. there are no vr interactions, you don't need to use your motion controllers at all. there is some replayability because your reactions do effect what happens. i did notice one minor thing difference in my second playthrough, where the light bulb did not explode as it had in my first playthrough.

i did enjoy the experience overall. the abandoned hospital looks really good, with a lot of attention to detail. the lighting is also very well done as well as the sound mix. there is good spatial audio here and very good particle effects. also, this experience does not rely on jumpscares, although there are some. instead, most of the horror is just from the atmosphere and pacing of the experience. beware though, this is a slow-paced horror experience that slowly builds tension.

however, all is not perfect, i was not a big fan of the character models. they weren't really scary to me. the character animations weren't all that great either. also, you're seated on a completely empty wheelchair, you have no avatar body or hands. lastly, there isn't much context to what is happening. you're just kind of thrown into a situation. 

it ran okay on my 1060 gtx. started out at 90 fps, but did go down to 45 fps during the experience. still, it was pretty steady and did not effect the experience at all for me. there were no bugs or issues that i experienced.

[b]rate 6.66/10. despite my criticisms, it was good overall and i only paid $3 usd, so not a bad deal for the money.[/b]

"this is less of a game and more of an experience in imagination.  the sandbox principles are simple and intuitive.  sculpting in 3d with variable lighting and effects.  this game is amazing in its current state, i cant wait to see where it goes from here.  visiting other people and their creations is sublime.  so many interesting things being built daily and you can customize your avatar to unbelevable heights.  
this game is somewhere between fantastic contraption and mine craft.  you get a palette with numerous shapes that you can manipulate and change scale, size, color, particle effects, sounds, animations, you name it!  the possiblities are literally, limitless.

now don¡¯t get me wrong here it¡¯s a good game but the amount of try hards just makes it not fun in my honest opinion i think there should be casual and ranked because the amount of try hards in a normal game just makes it not as fun like it¡¯s really hard to play if you don¡¯t have a good reaction time because all of the try hards are jumping right in front of your face and it just gets hard to shoot them especially when they¡¯re trying really hard and getting all the good weapons immediately after responding so you can you¡¯re getting killed by like the smg or the shotgun when you just walked out of your spawn with a pistol it gets especially difficult when they jump behind you and you can¡¯t snap onto them immediately because if you¡¯re swinging around in real life you have to deal with the fact that your headset is most likely going to fall off your face at least once or if you use snap turning you have to turn the snap turn insanely high up but then you get the problem where if you accidentally hit the snap turn button you¡¯re out of sorts but all in all i recommend this game it¡¯s a good shooter but i¡¯d more so recommend contractors or onward but that¡¯s just my opinion?,1620271414,5, ,257592

"updated review as i have now completed this game.

words cannot describe how well executed this game and storyline is.

when you start the game for the first time, you will be intrigued by how solid the interactions within the world feels. you'd be wrong to assume that the controls are poorly made, because they're not. in fact, they are very good.

the game offers great challange but not something i'd compare to dark souls in terms of difficulty. everything makes sense and all gameplay designs are smartly made and are also easy to grasp and understand.

if you've played the previous half-life games and wanted to know what events unfolded right after the last scene in half-life 2: episode 2, then i highly recommend that you watch till the end of the credits after you've completed this game, as many questions does get answered there in form of a 'hidden' scene.

overall, a perfect score of 10/10 from me, as should be expected with all, or most* releases from valve.",1587829064,3,0,545489

"feels essential just because of how utterly terrible the desktop view is in steamvr, but it's got a long way to go before it's competitive with the free oculus dash software you get with that headset.

desktop feels snappy and responsive. it's (mostly) easy to resize and move the screen around to meet your preferences for screen clarity vs needing to move your head around to see things. sometimes clicking just stops working. i can take my headset off and click with my actual mouse, put the headset back on and i can move the mouse around virtually with my controller, but it wont click on anything anymore.  doesn't seem to be a controller issue since every button still shows as working in the controller test app, and without restarting steamvr or exiting vr at all, i can open a game and everything works fine. seems to be an issue with how the program passes your vr inputs through to the virtual mouse. 

windows 10 specific bugs also stop the soft keyboard from coming up, and the developer has seemingly made no attempt to implement their own virtual keyboard you can type on. searching the community pages suggests that this was in beta at some point, but honestly, it's hard to tell. there's a lot of focus on the oculus quest version of this app right now, and it's difficult to separate what's for that or what's for the desktop. i don't know why the steam forums are being used as a discussion for an unrelated version of the app. ""check the discord for betas!"", then the discord only has beta versions of the quest software. asking for help with the pc version of the software on their discord is immediately drowned out by support and feature requests for the oculus quest version. selecting the ""beta"" branch on pc currently doesn't change the client at all.

this is better than nothing, but it really should strive to be more than that.",1572810135,3,0,442461

this game is a true masterpiece. never have i ever enjoyed a vr game this much. the physics remind me of when the physics for half life 2 were considered unheard of. i spent like at least 10 mins. just messing around with the objects even before i got the gravity gloves. the story is way better than i expected. i thought it would be another cash grab for a video game with no work put into it but my god valve is still amazing and i think their next game will be even better than the last.,1585084009,0,0,558287

"i have been hanging hopes for some modifications to be implemented to save this wonderful application as it has all the necessary elements for tai chi. i believe that developers can make it one of top apps by adding the option to remove the teacher so that not to get visually distracted and would help also adding free style, this together with adding colorful beams of energy flowing with hands plus an aura like and other effects 'like with a click you could send a wave of chi energy towards any direction your hand is moving towards' would make me use this app everyday to help my mind to synchronise itself with the chi energy beams of lights.

other suggestion: consider adding foot steps on the grown (alternatively and to avoid looking down you can signal the initiation of a foot movement by adding glowing light on the teacher's feet few seconds before and during the entire movement range' to make it easier to follow the right body posture. this might help in solving the problem mentioned earlier of getting visually distracted by trying to follow both the balls and the teachers moves, as a change in the teacher feet position is difficult to follow or predict at time focusing on the balls.

i wonder if adding multiplayers is possible by having rooms in which several people can join?

update: 

i am very thankful for the developers' response as i could finally find the hidden 'explorer' menu which allowed me to do my freestyle technique 'awesome!'

i feel very very excited awaiting some new features to be implemented 'especially the colour beams of chi energy we can send with hands move by a click' which will make this app a as number '1' in helping to boost both mental and physical health staminas as the mind will find it easier to synchronise its brain waves with what it creates of visual effects 'rather than just imitating teachers' as the former can activate a positive feedback system. 
'i imagine how wonderful 'shifting the clouds' freestyle will look like if my dreamful suggestions came true' <3

update 27 oct: amazing edition by showing footsteps which made it easier to follow instructions; however, would turn much easier and less straining if footsteps are to follow my visual field or to run slightly above the energy balls. 
i very admire the developers¡¯ kind response to our humble suggestions and their enthusiasm to bring a user-friendly experience so that many people would benefit from. this reflects a divine intention to help and connect with others peacefully.

thank you from the depth of my soul and very well done !

peace _/\_",1572146614,5,"Thank you for your feedback!

1) Good news: teacher options will be coming in November¡¯s update, allowing you to turn off or mirror teachers to your preference. The current approach is modeled after traditional training rooms, which allow seeing the same move set from multiple perspectives.

2) If you¡¯re looking for a more open freestyle, there is an hidden menu option behind your start position in the main menu which sounds ideal for your uses. 

The goal of Tai Chi is to find focus in dedicated movement, mirroring the precision as a way to lose sense of self. If you¡¯re staring at the ball in focus you¡¯re achieving our goal!

3) Good idea! We¡¯ll explore this further.

We created this app to help people of all ages and experience levels experience Tai Chi. You might enjoy Flow Mode, which has no points, and is there to allow you to play without worries.

"i've absolutely loved the earlier mobile games versions. when i learned that they were making a vr version, i nearly lost my shit. i started to gather all kinds of expectations in regards to how cool it would be to be actually looking around a puzzle and interacting with them as if i was there. i hyped myself up and started to fear i had sowed seeds that would blossom into a huge disappointment. i am happy to report that i had not. 

the game is visually pleasing, and while i'd had loved to see a more free movement around the different areas besides the predefined spots you could teleport to, i do realise that would have complicated the game quite a bit. the puzzles are challenging enough to be engaging, but not at all impossible to figure out reasonably quick. and, if you get stuck on something, there are some hints to guide you along the way if you get impatient.

the game is not a long one though, and while the development of the game is guaranteed to have been costly for a rather small studio, the price is a bit steep  for the amount of hours of game play you get, and the game's replayability isn't great. that being said, the hours you do get out of it is really great and engaging. the puzzles are satisfying to solve, and the mystery interesting to watch unfold. the game's general ""aura"" is rather creepy, and while it never tries to flat out scare you, i myself found myself entering rooms quite cautiously, often feeling as if someone was watching me behind my back. 

my only complaint is the price, but it isn't a huge deal. if you can afford the price well enough, you won't regret buying this.",1585864726,3,0,383789
"at 2.5-ish hours, vanishing realms might seem short. however, it contains a lot of glimpses into what a full scale rpg might look like. vanishing realms is packed with small little puzzles, interactive environments, and encounters. fighting feels clunky at the start, but much more fluid after a few encounters. at one point, i was parrying one enemy with a sword, and another with a shield. the  two-handed battle axe and bow, are an absolute joy to wield.

i haven't tried hard mode yet at this point, but i'd like to see slightly more responsive ai. for most encounters. it's very easy to lure enemies to fight them one at a time. i'm sure this is a design descision, but i'd take assasin's creed style circling over enemies just standing still.

"on my second excursion into the zone i found myself walking to an objective. there were two logical paths to reach the objective; through a narrow set of canyon or through a narrow set of canyons filled with water.... though to myself; well i sure don't want to get jumped while in the water.... so i headed for the dry land route. as soon as i reach the mouth of the canyon i get jumped by a half dozen mimics running at me. so i back pedal while yelling expletives; expending most of the ammo for my prized tt in the process (it was only my second run). 

after cursing my poor decision of trying the land route i decided to piviot and give the water route a try rather than risk the last of my ammo (and health!) shooting through the land route. which worked out fine for about 2/3 of the way through the water. then the game glitched out and i drowned while i was stuck and couldn't move... losing all of my gear and my prized tt to the watery depths.

a hard lesson indeed.

some updates later the game has technically improved in some aspects. hands are more stable now. but the entire rest of the game is a janky mess. some jank is intended and somewhat acceptable, but not in this dimension.

the game performance is atrocious even with the lowest settings and undersampled resolution. the game pretends to run with 90fps and good frame timings, but the judder is unbearable. it feels like the game is internally running at 30fps and not 90.
more than three zombish visible? performance is tanking like crazy and dynamic resolution is very agressively making the game look worse than doom 1. even the new super empty sandbox only takes one or two enemies to tank performance.

pretty ridiculous considering my hardware: gtx1080, i7 6700k, 16gb ram.
if i wasn't a vr veteran with an iron stomach, i'd have puked more than ten times before even finishing the museum.

if there was native oculus sdk integration in the steam version it would probably run a little better. opencomposite brings massive perfomance improvements (but offset hands), so the subpar streamvr integration is partly to blame (again).
i regret not waiting for the version on oculus home because this right here is not an experience i would recommend to anyone using a non-steamvr native hmd. and i'm not gonna spend 30 again just to get native oculus integration.

once the terrible perfomance and permanent judder gets fixed, i'll change my review. but i honestly doubt it's going to happen.",1586793725,2,0,717999

this game is really fun and gives plenty of exercise. i really like the   graphics really well down and the tracking work well when climbing on the rocks. hope you guys have more levels? because i think this one of the best i played on the quest.    like all the features such as chalking   and even the falling off is fun band the dark levels  ???",1580181814,5, ,182225

"yes, bethesda lazy af. in-spite of that, this is actually an amazing game! 
i'm using a quest 2 with my aorus 15g laptop (rtx 3080 8gb). this looks and feels exactly like doom 2016. same mechanics (i.e. health/ammo from flashing enemies) and music is the same. as other recent reviews say: just customize the controls in steam vr settings. there are a few ready-made presets for quest 2 and if you improve/tweak something, you can directly share the preset with all players.",1629347216,3,0,673841

but it does get boring pretty fast. the youtube player helps. my biggest complaints are that you can't turn your avatar while fishing without actually turning your body. you should be able to turn avatar while fishing with controller just like you can while in lodge. you should be able to move boat and walk up in down river bank with controller just like you can in lodge too. would be worth 5 stars if you could do that. seems like more cosmetic items need to be added too.,1653922800,5,Hello Tyleran.

"[h1] experienced on pico 4 using virtual desktop [/h1]

this is a great game. it is a crafting/dismantling puzzler. it takes place in a mountain range and has beautiful visuals and sound design.

you need to think outside of the box to progress with tasks, there is also a great written narrative to the game. the tool implementation and mechanics are like no other that i have experienced in vr.

a great place to relax and enjoy the views and sounds while being totally immersed in the puzzle solving.

this a truly unique experience to vr & i look forward to progressing further into the story.

"as a seasoned and old school tabletop role player i thought this game was going to be just a short term novelty. however i was pleasantly surprised by this game with well polished graphics and animation.  the game play and controls,  for the most part,  is easy clean to interact in. 
the only minor shortcomings i noted were:
* a lack of save feature
* solo skirmish you  only get to pick one class and the other two are randomised. 
*no clear way to go back from game-type selection without restarting.
*a marker to show where your miniature piece originated from once you pick it up.

this game has plenty of play value and i'm not sick of it yet.  however with the above noted resolved in some form plus  more content that is added, would just give it that last icing on the cake to make this game a total winner.

"[b]in general[/b]
this is remarkably good fun and there is a fair bit more to it that it would at first appear. once you get set up (use the height poster next to the settings panel) you can do pretty much anything you like in any order.[i] i did find that the stairs were a problem until i realised that i had made myself much too tall. this was fixed completely the moment i used the poster and matched the size[/i].

the fairground rides are pretty good all on their own, and having the ability to choose from a bunch of weapons to shoot targets while riding them is a novelty all of itself, however do beware if you suffer from motion sickness in vr - some of the rides are full on rollercoasters and you might find yourself having to close your eyes although there are a fair number of ""stand still and shoot"" games to play as well. its a simple game where beating your own score seems to be the way forward, but there is a lot to explore, including a drivable boat that can go right around the island.

[b]bugs and/or problems[/b]
i found a few. firstly i play on an htc vive but use index controllers and am not keen on having to constantly hold the grip in order to hang on to my guns. there is an option that says it is able to toggle this on and off, but it does not seem to work, or it is too sensitive so i keep dropping the guns. this is [i]very[/i] annoying when you are on a ride!
i have fallen off of a ride once, and ended up falling through the floor with no apparent way out except to exit the game.
if you fall into the ocean while exploring you will sink into the darkness, however, if you start running about you will end up respawing eventually. this is fine, but it does take some time so it would be helpful if there were a message displayed to tell you what was happening.

"the graphics are exceptional, making solid use of the oq2 capabilities. better price than i initially expected it to be. people complain about the speech being too quiet, just turn down the music a bit in your settings. i am not far into this game so cannot as yet give a more detailed review. but i find that the left+right snap turning controls are a little on the unresponsive side, where you need to find the precise angle on the stick for it to respond which is frustrating, particularly if you¡¯re in a hurry. i would also like to see smooth turning implemented as an option.

the gun aim seems a little off, it feels more like trial and error. i also lost my small standard blaster whilst still on the ship not long after i first found it. pretty sure it shouldn¡¯t be lost, but it isn¡¯t on my belt anymore and i¡¯ve looked everywhere for it. possibly a bug?

asides from this, it is quite a lot of fun to play. it is quite easy to figure out with not too steep a learning curve. nice to know that expansions will be made available in the future too. i will rate this 4 stars for now, as it is enjoyable so far plus this is a brand new game released only today and am sure will improve as any bugs are ironed out.",1605842614,5, ,281510

it is super fun in it's own right just as a dance game¡ªyou feel like you're really in a club having fun dancing with other ppl. what makes dance central great is the selection of music from big name artists across pop, hip hop, 70's, 80's, 90's music and onward. the dances are also really well choreographed and fun to learn.

"oh boy.

it's a bit of a mixed bag, here, but..  i do think i'll recommend it.  i really wish there was a ""maybe"" option.

when i first got my htc vive, this was one of the first vr games i ever played.  at the time, i thought it was one of the coolest vr experiences that have ever come out; i loved it a lot, and i thought everything was perfect.  i'd always boot it up to play the shooting range for example, because it was cool, even if it was a bit of a hassle to actually get to it (which was addressed in a recent update).   i found the missions really cool, even though the voice acting was (and still is) really cheesy.  it felt really clunky, but i forgave it for that, since it was one of the only vr games i ever played, so i wasn't as aware of the experiences players could have on the platform.

nowadays, though, coming back to it, i usually just play other games instead, because i feel that the unique direction contagion vr has isn't being focused on enough.  they're sorta cramming in a bunch of things but not focusing enough on those individual things, or, not focusing enough on one individual thing to give the game some focus.  they only just now revamped the target range, for example, but it's still hard to play due to games like h3vr which does it a lot better; there's the missions, but it feels kinda cheesy, not so much the story (it's a zombie game, duh, it's gonna be cheesy), but the voice acting is usually a tad goofy, and sometimes things don't feel as polished as they could, like the animations; there's the weird survival ""open world"" thingie, but it's not really open world, it's more just a survival arena where an escape route eventually opens up.  there's not much to do in it except run around aimlessly and shoot things when you finally find weapons and guns, as the maps are really tiny.  there's apparently a crafting system, or, at least it's advertised in the game at ""workbenches"", but i've never used them, 'nor do i have any clue how.  if their functionality isn't implemented yet, then that explains that i suppose, lol.

there's also a new mission that came out where you play as a young girl trying to escape from a new mansion after her parents become zombified.  i can tell they put a lot of work into it but wowee it's just..  really not fun.  especially if you aren't easily spooked.  it doesn't really scare me so i just have genuinely no fun on it, since there's no real mystery to unravel or anything.  you're just escaping.  i tend to have a rule when working on horror games or playing horror games, and the rule is that, if a game isn't scary to someone, then it should still be fun or interesting to play.  i still haven't beaten this mission, because, unlike a little girl, i don't really get scared of being chased by zombies.  hell, running away from zombies was already something i was doing a lot in the 'open world' parts that were super cramped.  so it was less an adventure and more ""aimlessly wandering around, trying to figure out what i'm supposed to do, or what i'm doing"".  sometimes ideas didn't really work, despite the fact that they should, like not being able to use a lighter to ignite a spider web, in order to get to an important objective.  was i supposed to ignite something else with the lighter, like a loose cloth?  there's hundreds of ""loose cloth"" models all over the map, so that can't be it.  y'know, it's stuff like that.

but it still holds a sentimental place in my heart.  it's still fun to play when it's focusing on the right things, and that's story based zombie shooting and objective hunting.  some of the puzzles aren't very well designed, but the ones that are, are always a blast to solve when exploring the map.  there's also parts like protecting your girlfriend/wife/whateversheis from a rooftop with a sniper rifle, which was an absolute pain in the ass to aim with the old grip functionality, [i]because some crazy dude thought actually physically holding down the grip button for every single grippable object was a good idea[/i], but it was still really fun.  the inventory aspect was really fun, and managing your inventory was always an interesting prospect.  mission 1 definitely shines a lot in the potential of contagion vr and it was what made me so enticed to keep the game and continue playing it.  i feel like they're starting to focus on the wrong things, now, and it's worrying me.  because it's starting to turn into a game i'm not really interested in anymore.

on that note, they're genuinely trying to improve the game, and do a better job with it.  i have the utmost respect for them for that.  they could stop at any point, yet they don't; they just want to make a really cool vr game, and i commend them for that.  their problems aren't due to being incompetent or bad developers.  they're good guys, and they're really doing their best.  i always wanted to do a vr game but i've never had the patience for doing one myself; i'm working on one with another team, (one of those assets in that game is my profile picture!) and it's always incredible seeing art in a virtual vr space.  it's a whole new level of immersion, especially when it's your own work.  but i digress, that's off-topic.

the art is great, the gameplay is-..  decent, but the focus isn't really there.  when it hits the nail on the head, it does it exceptionally well.  but when it branches off, it does a bad job.  it sounds harsh to say, but that's just unfortunately the truth in this case.

some modes need to really be improved or remade if they're going to be interesting or truly unique.  the ""open world survival"" aspect is literally just small arenas with endless waves of zombies.  if this is going to be something interesting then it definitely needs to be expanded by a lot.  maybe creating an actual open world, with actual survival elements like hunger, health, heat, etc.; that would make it actually worth playing, instead of just being a sort of tacked on survival arena.  (or, leave the survival arena in, but make the open world thing a separate entity); the shooting range is just a shooting range, but too much focus on the shooting range would be a bit of a misstep unless they find something unique that makes it worth focusing on.  i could just play the countless other gun games in vr if i wanted a shooting range, because contagion doesn't really bring anything unique or interesting to the table, there.  it's good to have it, but it's definitely not a selling point to the game.  the missions are a great idea, mission 1 is always going to be my favourite, mission 2 is pretty okay; but i think they really need to focus on this aspect.  content like that is what contagion vr does best.  and when it does it right, it is what makes it awesome.  that's why i'm recommending this.  because it clearly has potential, and the devs are actively going to do their best to achieve that potential.",1563485042,2,0,683382

"[h1] experienced on the oculus rift with touch controllers [/h1]

this is a good game. it reminds me a lot of lucid trips. despite this game's popularity, i think i enjoyed playing lucid trips a little bit more (keep in mind, lucid trips released first). this game does focus more on climbing, but it's just a matter of degrees. to the top is between climbey and lucid trips and lucid trips is between to the top and lander 8009. the common thread is parkour action (by the way, try vector velocity as a cheap alternative to all these games that's just as fun). there's just so many good climbing / parkour games in vr, there's several i haven't mentioned.

i think a lot of the reviews for this game are confusing. when i read them, i was more confused by what the game was. and then i played it and realized it was more like i thought it was from seeing store page videos. several reviews mention point and click climbing. a better way to describe it is sticky hands with a defined reach beyond your hands (long sticky arms). no, you can't just look at the next object and climb to it. it has to be within your sticky hand reach, which isn't really that far. so you can point and click from one blue obect to the next.

however, it is almost always faster to use  both hands and jump from one blue object to the next. you jump (climb) much farther this way and after a few climbs without stops, you gain momentum and start jumping even farther. you can teleport to pyramids that open with balls (no joke) and that will serve as a checkpoint. 

unfortunately, it is not always intuitive where the finish line is. so you will spend some time just looking around trying to figure that out and lose time. so this game really wants you to try the courses repeatedly to get those medals it's important to improve your time because you'll need more medals to unlock courses. 

i stopped playing after 76 minutes because i needed 2 more medals to unlock the next course (medium level difficulty courses). the problem is that most courses take 3-4 minutes if not longer so you will get tired if you're trying to go fast because you'll be using both hands to make these vast jumps. i was all sweaty and didn't want to repeat an earlier course to progress the game.

the really nice thing is that there seems to always be something new in each course. that's pretty impressive considering there's 35 courses. at 76 minutes, i only have 13-14 courses beat (with at least bronze medal). the music is relaxing, which seems to be counter to what a parkour game's music should be. but since i'm also from austin (devs & musicians located there), i'll say just enjoy it and relax :d haha

"yuru camp is one of my favorite anime of all time, but unfortunately i can't recommend this game, especially not at the current price.

this needs more narrative or gameplay elements to make the experience worthwhile. integrating memorable scenes from the show beyond simple references, or activities such as setting up tents, gathering firewood, or cooking (which would be amusing in vr) would have been nice, but none of that is present here.

quite honestly, the fact that this has 45 minutes of content and costs $20 says a lot. for that price, you may as well go buy two of the manga volumes - they'll be better value.",1630532371,0,0,414764

this is, by far, the most polished vr game i've played so far.  graphics are top shelf.  controls are intuitive and satisfying.  combat is challenging.  environments are incredibly immersive, especially the ones in the dark.  you find yourself fumbling in the dark, with a flashlight, trying to reload your weapon as a headcrab lunges from somewhere behind you.

"strikethrough = issue rectified

okay okay, incredibly rocky launch as i write this. super buggy, [strike]no graphics settings[/strike], [strike]no turning settings[/strike], [strike]horrific controller offset for quest 3[/strike] and [strike]forced toggle grip.[/strike] a lot of cardinal sins that has left me pretty dumbfounded as to how you can ship a vr game without these additions (even in early access) in 2024.

but heartshot is incredibly fun. the combat is supremely fluid once you get a hold of things and the satisfaction of taking out a roomful of guys is carried by their over-the-top ""facility goon"" communications and the downright incredible sound design. also wanna take a moment to appreciate the graphics, striking this really beautiful modern-retro style that reminds me of compound vr with a dash of polished voxelly goodness. it's also really well optimised in the hour of arena that i played!

the story presentation up to what i played was also fantastic (up until i fell through the map and had to restart), it felt really cinematic and actually has me excited for the rest of the story content; bonus points for the intense movements in the opening scene, not many vr devs are brave enough to do potentially sickening cinematics.


edit: just wrapped up act 1 on balanced difficulty, got some random thoughts to throw out in regards to its current state. firstly, the graphics shine once again through the different set pieces here, and the environments have some very neat details, especially the easter eggs you can spot on various screens; overall a very pretty game.

secondly, the weapons are in critical need of rebalancing, all of the two handed weapons are garbage and deal similar if not worse damage than any pistol. to add onto the disproportionate arsenal, the deagle one hits everything! why can't the shotguns do this? i get the real power and cool factor of a deagle, but actual balancing is a little more important right?

[strike]also, please add item holsters. my god, please.[/strike]

additionally, i have just a little personal gripe. it's very annoying when games sprinkle around so much ammo but put a cap on how much the player can hold; it feels like you're punishing the players that explore more, especially when you consider most of your playerbase has absolutely played half life: alyx and are likely a pro at tearing apart vr environments for any morsel of bullets, i think discouraging this is not the way!

[strike]finally i ask for something just a little technical, please give oculus players the ability to play through the steamvr runtime. some pcvr users have unorthodox setups and being restricted to using the oculus runtime on an oculus headset can either kneecap or jeopardise the experience for some folks. adding this option would heftily maximise compatibility, whether it be a launch menu option or the game just sticking to the user's set default openxr runtime (like what bonelab does)[/strike]

"so first off i will admit my downvote this game is relative to me personally as there is some issue between older skyrim vr mods not recognizing the new skyrimvr.exe vs the older tesv.exe(btw for those who don't know most skyrimvr mods are based off of skyrim se mods). i'm am a relatively inexperienced modder but do have some experience, so i've been able to figure out a few workaround?but its been hell trying to figure this all out. so while i can't blame that part on the game i can blame everything else about the game, what people say about this being a lazy port are absolutely correct. i have never played a vr game with more unintuitive controls and that's the main reason why i can't stand playing this game without at least some mods to help with the ui, combat, movement, and player model interactions(yes there are many issues, and i know there's more that i don't know of yet or haven't encountered). overall it just feels like a hot mess that bethesda is trying to squeeze money out of people for. i only paid $17 for the game and it still feels like i got ripped off. honestly, at this point i'm afraid to launch the game cause after 5 mins in the ""tutorial"" scene at helgen seeing how awful the interactions were with swords i proceeded to spend the next 55 mins of gameplay literally just restarting the game to see if i could fix some of the issues with mods. but i can't stand it vanilla so hopefully, i get some responses on my forum post on reddit to help me fix these issues otherwise this game is an absolute return. so basically if you're wondering if it's worth spending the money to get this unless your an experienced modder and/or willing to take multiple hours to learn how to mod this game i honestly wouldn't even bother. because as the base game stands it's basically unplayable. i love the elder scrolls series and really wanted this to be at least decent, not even good just decent and i couldn't even get that out of this. worst case if i do go over the 2-hour return window at least i can say i got it on a steep sale, please whatever you do don't pay full price for this game. if the game is this bad inherently and it basically requires the work of multiple 3rd parties jumping through a?loophole to make this all work i honestly don't think that the company should deserve the money for the game. especially considering really all the game is, in reality, is just a quick and dirty port.",1592542461,3,0,606888
"i really wanted this game to be good and fun, but it made me suffer for almost every hours spent there.
1. it's buggy af.
i was stuck countless times in textures. you will probably too if you are very curious or aren't careful enough. also each time you get too deep into the textures you get a bright orange flashbang in your eye: amazing solution for the game where most of the time your are wondering in the almost pitch dark environments.
when i was introduce to gas mask i have managed to glitch all filters to became empty which prevented me from finishing a level. only chapter restart help.
i have spent more then 2 hours in the room with labyrinth. i roamed it thoroughly countless times. i have checked multiple yt walkthoughts. i just don't know what i did first time, but loading chapter from the beginning helped again.
2. second riffle backpack. i don't know, if i missed some hits, but game told me only at like 2/3 about this mechanic. before that i was playing with pistol + rifle only. i just don't get it: it's strange, it isn't obvious and i have never meet a game with same design for handling multiple main guns.
3. there is just too much storytelling. i'm getting very bored when i'm stuck in small room with 2-3 npcs and i'm forced to listen to them for 5-7 minutes. it's fine, but it just doesn't works well for vr games.
4. it's just feels strange. i know that this game is a total spin-off and 4a never even touched it. seems like they got a lot of inspiration and worked really-really hard on this game, but they just didn't get how some parts of metro universe works.
5. no russian audio. i get that many ru and cis users don't have vr headset and will miss this title. i'm almost ok that there isn't dedicated ru voice acting. i just don't get why occasional ru words even with en voice were recorded such badly. pronunciation is very off and sounds like poor gta4 accent.",1734801190,0,,183302717

                     virtual reality is built for horror games, and narcosis does a great job of laying on the terror of being stuck deep under the sea. it¡¯s a simple idea that works well with the story, and if you¡¯re looking for something that¡¯s going to make your skin crawl and give you that tingly feeling of horror down your spine, then narcosis has everything you¡¯d ever want from a horror game.

"quick review: at release, mechanics incentivize exploits, so gameplay does not match (at least my) understanding of the gameplay vision.

the idea of breaking swords and sword health sounds great. however, simply touching the end of your sword to an opponent's hand breaks their sword almost completely. this works with some variability based on class (longer swords seem to be able to use the exploit more). unfortunately, this was enough for me to lose interest.

additionally, body placement is misleading and minimal, and the fights are long buildup with very little interaction time. these both contribute to a feeling more of a marathon sumo match than a complex and engaging arcade-like sword fight.

the game does look great though, and i like the idea, so i am not against giving it another shot later.",1668739045,0,,125663437

"this game looks, sounds, and feels great.  quality abounds.  audio is outstanding.  voice acting is excellent.  character animations are world-class.  the left hand interface gadget is such a slick way to combine basic game elements in an in-world way that feels fun and simple to interact with.
however, it's also lacking in some key areas that would better support that surface quality.
firstly, snap turning only is a massive mistake.  i realize this is done for comfort reasons, but it's become pretty standard for vr experiences to offer an option to disable it. moreover, i'm among those who find snap turning more uncomfortable and disorienting than smooth turning. please consider adding an option for smooth turning.
secondly: basic vr interactions seem clunkier and less intuitive here.  things like grabbing, picking up, and interacting with the world.  why do i have to have my hand exactly within a narrow range to pick something up?  why not widen this range, like nearly every other game?  
and the inventory system is really clunky and not very suited to seated play.
and finally, the jetpack: why is it necessary to use this clunky elevation system rather than just having teleport target the surface above that i'm pointing at?  every other game manages this fine.  and since i can't move laterally when using the jetpack, it doesn't seem to add any value.  it feels like a bad workaround to a design failure rather than a feature.

and of course, it's far too short for the price.  but i paid it anyway, and i don't really regret it.  i just wish i'd gotten more for the money.",1606015414,5, ,281298

1) to be able to point through open doors
2) a little lag problem which you can use a more powerful server
3) it would be awesome to let the player come back to the same room in like 2 minutes and then if he/she didnt then let others to replace him/her
 4) maybe also a time limit for each player to do his/her move would be nice because some people dont care about other's time

i enjoyed playing it and the guns feel good to use, i only have 2 complaints, number 1 is the left handed option doesn't move the ammo so i have to reach under my arm to reload my gun, number 2 is when you try to grab you gun by the barrel you sometimes grab stuff on your belt.

(for developers if they read this)
i have some suggestions to fix these issues, make it so ammo on your belt can only be held with the trigger and move the pistol down a bit more to your waist to give it a more natural feel and out view. the reason i want the pistol to move down is because when i try to hold the barrel of my gun i sometimes pick up the pistol instead

"skyrim vr is an 8/10

full video review here:  https://youtu.be/crybowrvxi8

movement:
- button mapping is a little unintuitive (shout where you'd expect sheath weapons)
+ all the locomotion options you could want are there.  teleport, smooth, fov filter
- felt like the limited run mechanic drags a bit in vr as you'll be on your feet for a long time

menus:
- lazy port of pancake game menus dropped in to vr.  skse and skyui can't come soon enough
- should have been able to control with touch (see doom 3 bfg vr mod menus)
- need to do 3 button pushes to get to menus, could have easily been done in 2
+ looking up at skill trees is like looking from the ground up at a galactic roots system
+ flying over skyrim map gives great feeling of flying high over the world
+ hud is in a good naturally placed location

handling:
- no real left handed support
+ weapons felt substantial and accurately placed
+ blocking is instinctive
+ overall the combat felt like an improvement while still remaining true to the original title
+ bows are the star of the show, would pay just for a skyrim bow minigame
+ casting magic feels like you have real power in your hand
+ reading books and docs is nice and clear
- picking up items is fine, but would have been better to pick up with grip buttons

open world:
+ this is where the game truly opened up and the grandeur of skyrim became a real virtual reality
+ i wanted to take my time and explore
+ scan standing stones under the on-look of bleak falls barrow cast in the shadow of a scarlett moon
+ overlook the dual falls leading in to riverwood 
+ look up at the snow falling in to my mouth as i¡¯m observed myself by aurora like lights in the winter sky
+ cast a distant view over whiterun as the mountainous landscapes bear down on the city
+ compelled to move forward and make legend from a mortal frame

gameplay:
+ quests felt more meaningful than pancake version
+ kill bandits, leave them dead, naked in the snow.  to be preserved as a corpse until the summer months, when the ice melted, the wolves feasted on their meat, and their bones were taken back by the weeds
+ killing dragons had me looking for a spot to put a foot up, and stand triumphantly over their disolving ashes

graphics + mods:
if you're not using mods with this game then you are missing out on a crucial aspect

performance:
+ i7 7820x cpu, gtx 1070 gpu, 16gb ddr4 ram --> all game settings on high, around 15 heavy mods, 1.2ss in oculus (about 140% in steam vr), almost never dropped a frame and maintained 90fps

rating:
8/10
clipping issues aside, shitty non vr menu aside, little niggles and big niggles aside, this is hands down the best vr rpg available to date.

summary:
skyrim vr has charm in the way it disconnects you from the physical limitations of virtual reality and compliments it.  and it rewards you with experiences you just won¡¯t find in any other vr title to date, and by default any game to date.  that is, provided you are willing to accept the world.  stop being so analytical about every little technical aspect and just let go.  use a little imagination like you did when you were a kid and build upon that framework to appreciate the hypnotic sights that are to be revered in tamriel.

i only played 20 hours of flat game because the i didn't find clear direction, and i didn't connect with the characters so the story didn't drive me.  but the vr version did.   i felt compelled along the paths to do all the little side quests, and for the first time ever, i enjoyed them, and i enjoyed meeting people, admiring the sights, and growing as a character, because it was all too fantastically real.

so, if you like rpg's, you like dragons and shit, and you have a pc vr headset, then this game is 100% worth your time, again, in my opinion.

"ok i'm going to update this review since i now have more hours under my name, this is without a doubt the most immersive and impressive vr experience i've played. there are points in this game where the graphics are so god damn realistic it's genuinely hard to tell the difference between real life and alyx (apart from the box on your face of course). 

i only have one complaint so far and that is the melee, or rather lack of, there is a point in the game where i found a metal bar, naturally i tried to use it to conserve ammo and fight a zombie but i was disappointed to find it did nothing. i did however yeet a headcrab out of a window with a box so that's pretty fun. 

if you have a vr headset that is compatible with this game go and buy it immediately, if you don't start saving up for one and buy this game immediately, it's a must have.

"the concept is good, it is essentially warioware, inc. if it was a vr game. however, there are some things that i wish are fixed. i have the minimum amount of space that steam vr can support, and for some of the minigames i cannot reach (such as poke and sometimes high five) an i'm forced to lose. another thing that would help would be controls. i am aware that they do change between minigames, but at least say how to do that. an options menu could do as well. if they fix these issues, then you would have a good game.

edit: played more of the game and beat two levels. i see now that when i complete a minigame, it says i lose, even though i didn't. please fix the game and i would change my review.

edit 2: this edit is after the 1.0.2 version, and i'm happy to say that most of my complaints are fixed, well done! there are still issues here and there but that is common in games. the game is really fun to play. totally recommend now.",1562971825,0,0,381601

"update: i've since finished the game (i restarted from the beginning to see how the game plays after the last big update). well worth the $ - especially with even more content soon! i've removed some of my criticisms from my review below as they seem to have been addressed. the current game does end suddenly - but i'm eagerly awaiting more. 

old review: i have been playing this for a week and really enjoying it. it's extremely simple in execution, and yet keeps me on my toes, spinning around in my living room watching behind me (when i can!).

yesterday i died on the last level, so i shut down and came back today to finish it. as soon as it loaded i noticed a baseball bat in a locker. hmmm... never seen one before. the there was a wrench, and a pipe, and rebar i think... anyways. i do love how you can put a melee weapon on your back. really like that. i'll echo another comment i saw here - the baseball bat feels like a pool noodle. whereas the wrench felt solid for me.

i ended up just not using any melee weapons at all since they aren't as fast as killing zombies most of the time. except for once i knocked a zombies head straight off with one hit and that was great!

i do want to mention crawling through the vents. i love that - but the issue i have is it's near impossible to draw a gun out of a holster when doing that - if you spot a zombie down in a room - it's too hard to draw a gun to take him out stealth like. 

however - all that nitpicking aside - this - is 'the' game i had imagined when i bought my quest. it's simple, the graphics work well. i don't quite get the story - if there is one lol - but it's given me some good jump scares. for the $ - it's easily a must buy.

"vr has been around on the consumer market for over 3 years at the time boneworks was released. there is a mountain of lesser games that has been released that could make you think vr ain't all that. well you owe it to yourself to get this gem.

you could call this the ""hand"" game. forget everything you're used to about video games and even vr for a minute. imagine picking up a rubber duck, but being able to put your hand anywhere on any side of it. imagine manually picking up a cardboard box, set it on a surface, and being able to push and pull to adjust it like in real life, using one hand as a pivot while the other pushes or pulls for example. well this video game allows you to do this and much more.

it's basically a game where you are stuck in some sort of vr simulation that uses ""advanced physics"" and you must find your  way out of it by solving a myriad of puzzling obstacles and fighting against out of control digital entities.the way you want to go about it is up to you : the game allows you a level of freedom unmatched to this day in the ways you want to approach your obstacles, from building bridges instead of pulling levers to move platforms, climbing over things instead of fighting, solving puzzles by stacking stuff into a pyramid for an hour instead of using much simpler direct approaches. it's special.

if you have a pc vr headset around early 2020 you really would be missing out if you didn't have this in your game library. recommended.

"i can very easily say this is my favorite gear vr title out of the entire oculus catalog, and i say that with utter regret, because of the head-turning, nauseating control scheme.  

props for adding the recent control option to the game, at least.  being able to turn with the touchpad instead of swinging around in my chair is absolutely a step in the right direction, but the turning is still very sharp and jarring.  by the time i'm almost through the first mission, i'm already ready to exit the game.  

i can give a couple of stars for the game's outstanding visuals, audio and overall polish... those are all great.  but i cannot, in good conscience, give more than two stars to a game i can't stomach playing for more than a few minutes at a time.   

unless better support for the vr controls (or heck- i'd even take gamepad support at this point; -anything- to stop using my head to steer), i can't play this game and i regret spending money on it.   here's hoping for an option or something to help fix this... i so want to play this game!  i'd happily adjust my rating to 5 stars in a heartbeat if this issue is corrected.  if not, then best of luck.",1528255414,5,"Hi, Please try out update 1.2.

"okay, as a person who has modded the sh*t our of skyrim vr to the point its easily the best way to enjoy skyrim, i can say for certain that fallout 4 vr, even modded, is an atrocious experience. 

getting it out of the way, the base version of the game is just terrible, you literally don't even control floating hands, you control like... a disembodied pip-boy and whatever weapon you're holding, shooting is unsatisfying and still has jank fo4 bullet spread so you never hit what you're aiming at, and forget using a scope.  the base fo4 vr experience is a nightmare, and not worth the price. 

as for modded, firstly, god bless the people who made frik and such but it does not fix fo4 vr like skyrims higgs/vrik did.  its a technical miracle they managed to do it at all, but hoo boy its a jank and even after calibrating i found i was better off just using arms-only mode and trying to ignore the fact my arms were attached to the top of my skull.   however even with these mods the game still felt disjointed and extremely hard to get into. 

i tried installing some positional ""holster"" mods to make the experience a bit less menu intensive since operating the pip-boy menu was finicky at best even when it was working, unfortunately that mod, while very good, was very difficult to consistently get to work, especially since i had to play with arms-only mode in frik due to in-game body being possessed by a demon and acting on its own free will half the time.  i did eventually get a decently sorta-consistent left chest pistol set up but it was not reliable enough in the heat of battle to use effectively. 

all in all, this was truly an unfortunate experience, nearly half of my 2.4 hours on record was trouble-shooting and getting basic things to work, the rest was realizing it was all for nothing because the experience itself was unsatisfying from the lack of physical presence to the gunplay being downright unbearable to the fact you don't even reload your guns because its a lazy port. 

where modded skyrim vr becomes better than flat screen version and is in my opinion the best way to experience the game, fo4 vr is noticeably inferior to the original and mods, while fixing some issues, are janky and unsatisfying thanks to the poor quality of the base game port itself, and not at all the hard working modders trying to polish this turd.

this is like, my second not-recommended review i've ever posted.  its so bad. 

the only thing i can say is if you can get it on sale for under $10 and you can accept that your entire physical presence in this game is a floating gun, it might be worth it if you really love vr and fo4.  but for everyone else, just avoid it. 

if i hadn't spend more than 2hrs in this game, i'd of refunded it.  shame on me for trouble-shooting for so long... i only spent like $15 on this game and i feel ripped off.",1711844699,0,,161844092

"a meditation vr experience is a pretty neat idea, which work along with the vr mediums strength. unfortunately, the execution is just not good enough.

as in the trailer, each text instruction flies from the background towards you like some vr port of a powerpoint presentation. and the font is pretty hard to read too. i misread a sentence and thought that the meditation would clear my ""creativitity"" ... actually, it said ""negativity"". i love crazy fonts, but here it detracts from the experience.

the landscape is pretty low quality. you are floating in the air, and the proportions are way off.  the clouds are constantly changing form and, like the stars, they are moving too fast, totally spoiling my transcendicity. the grass textures wave back and forth inconsitingly with they direction the clouds are moving. the sounds of birds doesn't fit the sparse mountain environment, and there is noise from wind hitting the microphone.

on the positive side, there has been some effort put into making the environment go between day and night. a little buggy, but it work. turning the text off makes this a pretty okay place to chill.",1488117969,3,1,592746
"first impressions are pretty good. the game play looks and feels polished and it doesn't overwhelm you with information at first. the quests are easy to get into and don't take too much work to complete for someone who is just barely starting. i did run into some issues. a notable example is how the enemy npcs seem to aim at you inconsistently when they are about to attack. one would run at you and then, just before it swing its sword at you, it turns 90 degrees and slashes in that direction instead. some look like they don't even notice you even when you get close for some reason. since i just started playing the game i guess i need a better understanding of its aggro mechanics.

my next critique is not so much a complaint but so much as a request to the developers. please implement support for full-body tracking. it's pretty weird to see myself move like a half-body vrchat user in this game after i have gotten so used to playing vrchat with full-body. it would definitely increase immersion and probably lead to funny moments if fbt like vrchat or neos vr was implemented.

other than that, i highly recommend this game for the users who are deep into vr.",1643751675,0,0,406598

"i'm fairly early in the game but i'm enjoying it tremendously. 
the only downside is, as many people would agree, are the unappealing enemies. it fits the surrealistic nature of the game, but i get the feeling that those enemies were more like a smart low budget solution than what the developers would really like to have it, which is of course, mutated creatures/enemies of flash and bones. but as a 3d artist myself, i understand the smart decision and limitations in avoiding modelling, texturing, rigging and animating complex lively creatures as it's clearly the focus of the development was in the guns and vr interactions, which is the game strongest point.

i love the immersive simulation of it.. how you have magazines physically stored across your vest.. each magazine is in a different place, which breaks the routine reloading in other games that has you reaching for the same spot in your belt or over the shoulder to pick up a fresh mag. how you have to save your empty clips to refill them manually etc.

"a very fun game at times, but the weapons arnt balanced the best way

rifle - decent, will get the job done if you can aim, probably the most honest weapon in my opinion

sniper - can do really well on good days, but most people use it as a discount revolver so idk

grenade launcher - most people that use this will just run atyou to get that sweet sweet insta kill, basically discount shotgun

dual pistols - best allrounder weapon, good long range and medium range, and is the best shotgun in the game with its shotgun mode

minigun - fun concept, but considering most people can hit their shots youll be dead before you rev up the gun

shotgun - doodoo. its never used and even if you do want to use it, why? reloading is a hassle and there are at least 3 more weapons that do its job better.

smg - 
¡°hey jim¡±
¡°yea john?¡±
¡°can we add a weapon with immense damage that is good at every range and has barely any recoil when holding it with one hand even though its meant to be held with two?¡±
¡°sure, why not!¡±

katana - the funnest thing in the game, rewards the player for using it well, because your basically required to use it with skill or you¡¯ll be shreadded faster than those things people grind for their youtube videos

in all the game does have good moments and the novement is a blast, but the smg and the dual pistols basically dominate because of their immense damage and ease of use.( and before you say anything, yes some of the gun reviews are exagerated ).",1671772680,5, ,298409

one bit of advise i have is if you have an entry level graphics card like me (gtx 970 mini) and don't suffer any effects from lower frame rates turn off the automatic graphics level as it makes the graphics incredibly blurry for me. i found that the visuals were excellent, frame rate was just fine and the game perfectly playable when i opted to turn it off.",1569694334,3,0,505833

i'd say that you should play this game but not if you just started playing vr. in the start of the game, it says ""expert vr users only"" so if you aren't that great of a vr player and haven't experienced the vr physics yet. i'd suggest you that you play something else before you get all mad because its hard and leave it a bad review but if you are used to vr, i suggest you get this game. the physics is 10/10 and when you pick up something, they all have a unique weight to them. it feels real life like a little bit! i'm not gonna give you spoilers but there are puzzles that you need to solve but the game lets you take your time. also a thing to clear is that you also need a really good pc in order to play this because its gonna be laggy sometimes. alright thats all im gonna say. long story short, please buy the game :)",1648487413,0,0,708500

"this is a awesome game the forging mechanique are good just that the level for everything that as a link with crafting or forging as a limit and i think that it is weird 

the fighting mechanique welp good but there a lot of part were if you does something wrong in the time chamber you are well doom to fail or if you just want to test you weapon well sadly you cant leave the time room until your hp are at zero or if you broke all of your weapon

the worst thing in this game is the mining why because there isn't really any mining mechanique at all you just well turn on an old machine and it is slow very slow

i think it would be better to add another way to gain metal and im thinking about someting more interesting than just adding a mine it would be rather a donjon

technically in the game you are stuck in a donjon but i found alway asking myself where is the donjon ? 
and i think adding a door that lead to a randomly generated donjon could be a great add you could build yourself a pickaxe and going with your sword inside the donjon where you could find vein of metal maybe some chest with ramdom loot in it but also 
enemy like squeleton and i also think i could goes well with the resistence thing that isnt still implemented in the game because some enemy could have poisoned weapon or some of them could use magic

sorry for my english im french
and i love this game it's that it could be better with a real mining experience and it could even have a real donjon",1641316740,5, ,346977

"this may perhaps be a little odd to say, but it feels like a modern, fantasy-themed homage to the original doom. i think it took me a few hours to really see that comparison, but it's the best one i can come up with. for sure it's not doom-like in terms of guns/gore/theme/etc. but it's the way you end up approaching each room, keeping an eye out for carefully hidden enemies, the level design is also really well done and interesting, a very doom-esque thing.

the melee combat lives up to the description entirely. this is the new high bar for me, especially the velocity requirement. the parrying feels spot-on, i am almost always looking for a chance to switch from ranged to melee, and when you start taking on two enemies at once, and successfully time a parry/attack/parry/attack combo it's pretty awesome feeling. ranged combat is precise, it's not as visceral as melee, but solid and the two methods clearly compliment the gameplay.

i find myself saying this about a lot of vr games, but i wish it was longer. still have not beaten it yet, as i've been replaying the first two areas with friends in co-op (which is amazing) and i do feel like it is worth every penny, don't get me wrong. just kind of dragging out the last section (mostly so a friend and i can see the end at the same time) has given me time to solve the ""3 cranks puzzle"" and learn the dungeon layout pretty well. and it makes me hope maybe there's a ""new game+"" or something similar for endgame in the works.

all in all, solid, and just an all out enjoyable experience. i'm glad to see some real quality vr games coming out, this is among one of the few vr games i have played that feels truly ""all there"" in terms of design and execution. there's vr games i really enjoy that still feel somewhat ""tech-demo-y"" in parts, this is one of the few that does not feel like that at all. even in early access (so there's a few minor bugs to be expected) it's more polished than i would have expected. would drop some cash on an expansion in a heartbeat.",1582603746,3,0,598929

so overall 50% for this game it's fun and smt like training during long winter nights. i will not stop to play it but i think that i will never pay for subcrtiption that much sad. try to add some dlc or make subscription cheaper. apple music familly costs 9$ and this is music for 6 people not game with some classes for single account without offline play.",1626578614,5, ,171217

"game is pretty amazing. it is definitely aimed at vr newbies, which is a downside, but understand why they did it. to make this game but for vr vets, would be my dream. more action, a bit more fast paced and bigger fights, and much more motion sick inducing scenarios (for the newbs) is what i need! they need real jumping added into the game (breaks immersion using a teleport jump), arms on the character (not floating hands, as they break immersion), actual melee combat (no crowbar??? what the heck), weapon holdsters option on the player (game uses a menu to select other weapons, which breaks immersion even though their menu works well), and a few other tweaks in settings most vr games have. 

all in all it is a beautiful and amazing piece of work, really the standard for future vr games. the slow and creepy sections can be intense. there is a part when you have to get past ""jeff"" and that was pretty god damn intense. made me almost poo myself. was stressful and just epic! fighting swarms of crawler bugs is just the best. feel like i am playing star ship troopers haha! games sweet.

"rogue like shoot them up with some fun gameplay ideas. it's not your average shoot them up, as it's designed for vr, with moves in 3d. you don't move your ship permanently, but choose its destination, and aim at the opponents to shoot them using three kinds of weapons. the game arena isn't that big, but vr helps a lot to position every ship in 3d. the backgrounds are quite nice looking and sometimes interacting a bit with the game arena (with the creatures). but don't expect a massive scale space shooter, it's rather small scales space battles. 

replayability is quite good as the rogue like mechanisms are helping a lot. there are three different ships to use, their weapons being almost the same, so it's lacking a bit of variety there. game design is quite nice, it's polished. not a massive game, but some hours of good fun in vr with some good ideas is already very welcome! took me more or less 8h to finish a few runs & unlock the other two ships.",1719780422,0,,168636774

this is a pretty game for unity. unity is not my favorite game creating utility though. but from what i played this is a neat sci-fi vr game. i have not gotten in the meat of it yet but so far so good. this appears to be an ambitious gaming project so it is probably worth supporting. the locomotion in vive is track pad at this point. i have asked the dev to support teleporting while on the ground. in flight track pad may be needed for obvious reasons. this is one of the few more pricey vr games i would recommend supporting now because it feels like it has the potential to be a full fledged real game for vr. try it for yourself and see. remember, it is early access but i did not experience any major bugs at this time. enjoy.

"let me start by saying that i loved boxvr. it had some issues and could definitely use certain changes, but i played it every single day for months. it's been a huge part of my weight loss journey. i don't understand why they had to change everything so much.

positives: it's harder to maintain a streak than previously which makes it a sweatier workout. there are still some great songs.

negatives: you can't pick the environment. i personally liked the real-look gym in boxvr because it didn't give me a headache like the new one with the darkness and neon lights. you can't put in personalized stats like weight and height so the calorie count is ridiculously inaccurate. you're supposed to be able to box with other players but every time i did the others would stop tallying or moving about halfway through. you can't select songs and make custom playlists like before and the whole screen selection page for the classes isn't as well organized as before.

i was hoping that with boxvr they would do an update where you could scroll through and pick songs one at a time (like ddr) instead of having to make a playlist. i didn't expect them to just get rid of that altogether.

overall this new update is disappointing to say the least. if the game had been like this initially i probably never would have bought it. please bring back a classic mode for those of us that paid for boxvr. this is ridiculous.",1596252214,5,"Thank you for your feedback.

from exploring, combat, looting, buying equipments, etc really really reminds me of diablo.

u can use melee (with many weapons, from swords, broadsword, great sword, hammer, mace, dagger, spears, etc), and range (bows and magic).
so the replayability is great. 
the dungeon is big, there are some climbing ropes and walls to do, and combat is great.
the feeling of parry is good, and the physics is there.

and the developer has said that they would expand this game alot. 
the area and enemies would increase by alot and there would be crafting too later.

"i think this is a fun game. i didn't say great nor bad, but it's fun. i feel it's more for those who are looking for an arcade style zombie game that also has story and other unique aspects. there are some things about this game that need refining or polishing, some things that need to be added or done so that it could become better. if you're looking for an amazing zombie game with good voice acting and a bit of a realistic style to it, this isn't your game chief. the voice acting can be a bit wonky at times and there are many bugs where the zombies end up flying around, then your hand follows and you're surrounded by walkers with one empty hand and your weapons hand is 50 feet away. i enjoy supply runs and the story, i'm not saying the story was great and all, it could use some work, but it's definitely enjoyable. the supply runs have you on a time limit that's represented by a decently-quick moving herd (or horde, whatever you want to call it.). don't get all excited though, the herd is just a red wall with some 2d silhouettes of walkers. when inside it, you just slowly lose health. it does give this sense of ""hurry before they catch up and surround me!"", but has a bit of a disappointing execution when it happens. guns are kinda useless, it's not head shot to kill, it's more like 3 shots to kill unless you have melee, crossbow, or you continuously upgrade your guns. overall the game is okay, personally enjoyed it, and the developers seem to be really passionate about making this game better. maybe not worth the big $30 price tag but i'm remaining optimistic.",1602555959,3,1,379240

"i always felt like vr was a super poor investment, and that the lack of proper games made it a tool pretty much only for the turbo-enthusiasts who wouldn't mind a hobby that charges them out the ass for relatively little return. cause what, the only  made-for-vr games you really had were alyx which isn't very replayable, vrchat (and other similar titles) if you wanted to hang out with people, and myriad other sandbox games. before the 1.0 update, i still think this was the best vr game around, especially in the sandbox category. infinitely replayable, huge modding scene, and just downright fun. other games like boneworks ether suffer from early-vr-game jank with uncomfortable controls, but blade and sorcery has been honed to a razor sharp feel and, in my opinion, is gold standard on how a game should control. 

now that this game is fully out and i played it for a few hours, i can confidently say that vr is worth it, and this game is why. it's such a huge expansion on what was already an endlessly fun game, made with so much care and attention to detail over so many years. if you have a vr headset, you owe it to yourself to buy this game and play it. if you don't own a headset, this game and half life alyx are the two that i would say are absolute must-haves.",1718693894,0,,167611250

"fun game. love the interactivity it provides. movement seems good so far. wish there was a way to grab from behind and put to sleep or kill without alerting. if there is, please share.",1627269814,5,"Hi there! Thanks ever so much for the awesome review and rating and we're pleased to hear you love the game along with some of the aspects that go with it. :) In terms of killing and rendering guards unconscious without alerting there are plenty of various methods. :) You can opt to sneak up behind a guard if you wish and shout freeze. This will make them put their hands up and you can then do as you please with them. Bear in mind if you let them go though they will attempt to sound the alarm so it's best to either kill them or knock them out cold. Just ensure you hide the evidence. :) You can also drop on top of a guard from above and this will knock them out immediately. If you're using any weapons when you attempt these methods by the way ensure you're using a silenced gun if you wish to remain stealthy. You can also use the repair tool to electrocute guards from behind, you can punch them, these are just a few methods. Hope these help. :) Thanks again for the support and we hope you continue to have fun playing. :)",155331

"back in autumn of 2019, i bought myself a vr helmet in order to try the new, magical world of virtual reality and see what kind of new and awesome experiences it may provide. 

there were significantly less games back then, and most of them had wildly different mechanics because everyone was just figuring out how things are supposed to work. arizona sunshine was a gem back then - a coop zombie experience with a varied campaign, somewhat decent looting system, some interesting guns, and frequently fun and difficult levels. lack of movement using analogue sticks wasn't that big of an issue - the teleportation was enough. 
four years later (seven in fact, arizona sunshine came out in 2016, and second - in 2023), i booted up this game to recapture that feeling of fun zombie coop and i got... the same game. absolutely, 100% the same game, with the addition of a dog, melee weapons and some superficial crafting.

at this stage of vr gaming, it's kind of dissapointing to see - there are games with better looting systems, better melee combat, better shooting (especially up close) and better dialogue. this feels like a mod to arizona sunshine 1.

the most baffling issue i have is that the horde mode is lifted from arizona sunshine 1 with zero changes, except for a crafting bench and periodic material drops from the zombies. in 7 years, the developers didn't even let us change the starting wave and starting guns, forcing you to always start with garbage starting pistols and wade through 10 waves of slow and boring zombies before it gets interesting.

out arizona sunshine 1, 2 and 1(remake), i would suggest buying just a single one - remake of 1 - and you will see everything this series will ever be able to show you. which is enough for one game, but not 3.",1731760114,0,,179143193

it does have a free roam, open world sandbox mode called ""omega island"" which is the left option on your screen when you first start the game. there's not much to this mode, but you can collect collectables that eventually upgrade your jetpack and its a blast just to fly around the city in vr! i've always wanted to fly one of those jet packs from spy kids and this was like a childhood dream come true. 

there's also a story mode with missions that are super fun!

- add a little sound effect or visual que when a grass is done growing.
- add more levels, moon (space grass), area 51 (secret millitary grass), roof garden (weed), farmer garden (potatoes(?9).
- maybe a spotlight on the ground where you're looking to know you are stearing at a grass. the particles don't really do much.
- shooting the rockets out of the air should prevent fire. it seems like it only does it sometimes.
- unlockables like a stronger water spray, faster rocket, different skins. (i get that the stronger water spray and faster rocket is not fair for the leaderboards, different classes?.)

do recommend this game because of the cheap price and because the game is fun. there's just more potential.

(you can take a lot of hits on lower difficulties and you regen, but trying to get enemies off you when they get close is stressful af!) this is better than most vr apps that i've paid for. 10/10 graphics, terrifying and helpless environment (no locomotion other than turning), might just be the best vr wave shooter yet, get ready to piss your pants. i'll do a full playthrough at some point, but not today. it's over 9000% worth the asking price of free. i would have paid $15 for this easily.

"gameplay issues 
vail vr was made with comp entirely in mind yet lacks the skill ceiling of a competitive game. vail skill ceiling is abysmal when compared to other vr games like pavlov. the low skill ceiling was caused by the lack of recoil making all guns laser beams, the lack of any eco system, and the insanely fast ttk. vail has alot of gameplay issues with the peakers advantage being by far the worst. the peakers advantage in vail is by far the worst i have seen in any vr game because you will often die before you can even see the opponent making most of the fight determined by who peaked into the other. not to mention the lack of any eco system makes the game more stale as it allows players to only use 1 pistol and 1 rifle and never touch anything else. it also removes save rounds which can create some of the craziest plays of all time not to mention it removes the importance of winning specific rounds.
maps
the maps are all kind of bad. they all have really good concepts and i really like some of the unique features like the zip lines on maar. however the map's need some changes to make them good.
graphics/run-ability 
vail vr atleast in my opinion has some of the worst graphics. the games bland color pallet and brutalistic design is really boring and has no life to it. if you like to look at concrete then this game is for you. however the game runs terribly. a lot of players have a lot of issues running the game with it often times freezing which costed players rounds. but hey at least you can see concrete with dynamic lighting. 
is vail fun
i would be lying if i said that i didn't have fun playing the game but it's not due to the game being better than anyother vr game like pavlov its due to the fact that vail offered a new fresh experience and also the game devs have just been throwing money at the game to get people to play it which was why most of players in the comp league came to vail just for the money and didn't play the game because they enjoyed it. if you haven't tried anyother vr shooter or you're like me you will probably like vail but if you come from other vr shooters you probably will not like the game.
pros
while i have said a lot of bad things about the game i still want to give credit to where it's due. the devs care alot about the game which i can't say for other vr games like pavlov. the dev support is really great and they are always open to feedback so i do think that vail will improve.",1669172733,0,,126159941

"love this game! the most fun i've had with a music rhythm game since beat saber. reminds me of the days when i first picked up guitar hero or dj hero. once you get into the groove, i feel quite immersed in the gameplay loop. i tell myself i'll just play a few songs, but keep on adding just one more over and over.

a few criticisms, which hopefully will be resolved in future updates: the animation of the motion of the drum beats, cymbals,  as they come towards you seem quite jittery, and no where near as smooth as it should, compared to other similar rhythm games. also, in my opinion the menu ui could use some work. its neat that you have to tap each option like your tapping a drum, but its somewhat cumbersome. it be nice to give the player the option to quickly navigate the menus by following the movements of the controller. also, the number of clicks to go in and out of menus to select the next song to play takes a bit too long.

"this is a very good demo. i can't wait until they release the full game. as long as the developers can keep their promises, this will be a must buy. the game really reminded me of fable (at least in the world look, the gameplay not so much). from start to finish, i played 25 minutes with some wandering and looking around. the vr world is absolutely beautiful. and for the most part, you are free to explore around. 

you start off by talking to a group of friends by a campfire. the voice volumes were weird, they seemed low at times and then at other times the volume seemed fine. after this chat, you will ride a horse with your female friend. riding the horse here is not only fun, but very immersive. steering the horse becomes easy after about a minute to get used to the controls. you then get into town. here you can explore around and then meet up with your friends after getting some ale and snacks. and soon you're in a horse race and then the adventure begins. you have some magical powers and a town to save. in the demo, you only have a shield and a telekenises power. there's two enemy types. then there's a ""mini-boss"" spoiler alert : 

i did joystick movement on the oculus rift without any problems although i wish you could also turn without physically doing so.  game played without any crashes or game-breaking bugs. there was a bit of an issue during the horse race (game slowed up temporarily, but no problems save for those few seconds of the hangup). 

i had fun. i was sad at the end. i wanted to play more. we need more games like this in vr.  games that make you feel like you are a part of the game world.

  the gameplay is solid too. it delivers the best physics interactions that i've ever seen in vr (probably because most vr games are made in unity, and that can't compete with the source 2 engine). 
the movement options are a blessing. i'm so glad this game isn't teleport only. i love being able to walk around and crouch into small areas.

"[h1]star fox in vr with ship management[/h1]

when i had initially played this game back when it first came out, i did not like it. there were bugs, and performance issues. there was also one big thing i did not care for that i did not really expect, it is on-rails. this really put me off the game and i had refunded it. fast forward to now, i repurchased it and gave it another go. and... well, i actually like this game now!

[b]patches fixed performance & most stability issues[/b]

the game has been patched quite a bit since i first played it. i did not have any performance issues whatsoever this time around. the game is quite stable. there were a few times i did face some bugs where ziggy would just get stuck inside the energy extractor and i would not be able to grab him plus the energy pod did not detect him. this happened quite a few times for me, however, it wasn't game breaking as i could just stuff another ziggy inside and it would detect the new one.

[b]on-rails[/b]

now, let's talk about the 'on-rails'. like i said, i did not care for this initially. when i went in before, i was sort of expecting a space game with ship management, allowing me to fly wherever i wanted or within an 'arena'... however it does not play like this at all. sure there are a few levels that are 'arenas' where you fight a boss, but that's about it. during my playthrough, i did start to realize something... this game plays a lot like star fox, just with ship management! you are dodging and shooting other ships while also navigating the linear passages, like star fox. you can even shoot bombs like star fox too! putting this in my mind, caused me to actually forgive the 'on-rails' aspect and the game really started to grow on me as i played throughout the campaign.

[b]multitasking[/b]

the game has you multitask heavily. you constantly have to switch from piloting the ship and blasting enemies to managing your ship's integrity, energy pods, and feeding ziggys and extracting energy from them. this aspect of the game really does make you pay attention to your ships integrity and is quite fun and engaging. of course, you can play a ""story mode"" which disables the need to manage your ship, but i feel that would take out half the fun.

[b]story[/b]

because there is so much multitasking, i did not pay much attention to the story, honestly. its kind of a bummer since the art work of both the characters and world are very well done and the voice overs seemed to be good. i kind of wish that there were breaks in between to present the story rather than you constantly worrying about managing and piloting your ship constantly as i do not want to disable ship management entirely. perhaps in later playthroughs i can finally enjoy the story as i 'git gud' with managing the ship.

[b]vr interactions[/b]

i have to say, this game really does vr interactions very well. the way you insert cartridges, hitting buttons, and flicking switches in the cockpit, really feels good and satisfying. the controls are good and has minimal vr jank. very well done devs!

[b]overall[/b]

i have to say, i really wished i had the 'star fox' mindset when i first got it. after having this, i really like this game. there is some length to it as there are multiple passages to take (like star fox where you select which level path to take at the end of a mission). the game is quite engaging and requires your attention at all times. will be playing this multiple times to see all the paths it offers!",1699587696,0,,149847330

"a sloppy mess
i know this game is early access but what little there is....they should polish that before even think about making more content.  make what you have work before going forward & making more content that's all a mess.  blade & sorcery... what sorcery? there is no magic in this game.  at least i wasn't able to do none in my time with the game.  i just want to play the game i saw on steam's trailer.  when i saw that i was like wow that looks like a blast.  but whats advertised & what you get are 2 different things. the framerate is the worst i have ever seen in my life.  it just tanks when ever you are fighting.  i'm talking down to 10 frames a seconds.  to the point where you can not see what your doing.  so you just put your hand in front & swing your wrist back & forth & front of your face.  you do this over & over...rinse & repeat.  and there's no option menu at all.  there nothing for you to adjust....wow lol!  my rig plays most triple a games in 4k.  i just couldn't believe how horrible this game ran. 

hype
 after read all the reviews on here & all the hype behind this game.  i was expecting something completely different.  people make this game sound like gods gift to vr.  this game in it's state is unplayable trash.   should be priced at 4 or 5 dollars, if that.  because there is barely anything there.  and what's there is beyond a sloppy mess.  all the character creation....coming soon.   magic & campaign coming soon.  anything you can think of is coming soon.  i can not under state how sloppy this game is.  the only way to hit an enemy is when they are inside of you.  that's how close they get.  there arms & legs are literally inside you.  and all you can see there head just shaking like 4 inches from your face.  which makes me sick to my stomach.  and so you just put your arm & front & just swing your wrist back & forth again....over & over. you kill anything by doing this.  this is every single fight i had in this game.  and people think that's awesome.  i just need to remember not to go by reviews.  because a good part of the public is out there are most likely little kids.  anyways to land a hit you shouldn't have to get that close to an enemy.  

the good
the only 2 good things about this game is it's a good idea if if worked.  the game looks nice enough for vr.  and in all your wild wrist swinging is the worst combat i ever seen in my life in my 43 years on this earth.  and i love hard game such as the soulsbourne which are my favorite.  and part of the reason i got this. i guess killing things takes out some of your anger.  because you will be angry for wasting your time with this.  but having a good idea & what you present are 2 different things.  i felt like this was straight up false advertising after watching this trailer.  it's obvious that 90 percent of the review on here were from little kids or teenagers that think a game is amazing cause you can stab someone in the face.  i'm just shocked this game isn't overwhelming negative in reviews.

no motion sickness options
these are some of the worst controls ever.  the walk or run is way to fast.  the same with turning.  i wish there was options like almost all other games with turning.  such as turning 35 degrees or 45 degrees.  and moving that fast trying to make contact with an enemy.  you have to keep pushing forward for anything to connect.  and at that time the enemy is half way inside your body.  and i'm looking at a head a couple inches away from my face

suggestions to developer
to fix the framerate problem could be so easily fixed.  there's no need to have 3 or 4 enemies on the screen at a time.  you can only fight 1 really well in vr.  the other enemies are just annoying anyway.  it's hard enough to land a blow with one enemy who's jumping all around.  who know's maybe it's the speed you move, but it's just a mess. not to mention having 2 other enemies you can't see stabbing you in the back.  the game would be so much better & run so much better if the was one enemy you fight at a time.  and make that enemy challenge.  another problem is when fighting your weapon doesn't move accurate in vr.  it's hard to tell were it's at.  and most of the time it falls out of your hand & you can't pick it up correctly.  there's nothing worst then being attacked & not being able to pick your weapon up.  like i said there is way to much going on.  get rid of all the multiple enemies.  i understand why they did it.  it seems like a good idea.  but it's just not practical in vr.  one at a time is more then enough.  i would even think it's cool to fight standing in one place.  where you could focus on blocking & swinging & dunking ect.   but with these horrible controls.  it's a mess trying to move around with 3 or 4 enemies all around you.  i came close to swing my fist into my screen tv or hitting the walls.  because of these problems.  it just feels sloppy.  i will be getting refunded this game.
  this game seems like it's years away from being what it advertised itself to be.  i'm a rpg & souls fan & i really wanted to like this one.  i know it's early access but i thought there should be something good about this game to justify the purchase

"very interesting puzzle vr game.
to me it's a mix of the room with some cool ideas of the lab.
two great games combined together to create a fantastic vr experience.

- cool interactions with the environment
- beautiful lighting
- nice sense of scale and dimension
- fun to play with the objects and solve the puzzles

[b]what i disliked :[/b]
- not much of a story. i would have loved solving all those puzzles with an actual goal, or to have a stronger storytelling to care about.
  add that on your next game and that will be a masterpiece :)

however, then i unlocked slomo and zip (aka glory kill hehe) and starting unlocking new enemies and realized there are more weapons and suddenly i realized yeah this is arena-style battles, but with with a high skillcap and fun skills, omg this is doom eternal with webslingers in vr! hell yes!

"i don't believe that this film has played to the strengths of the vr medium. i think it's an interesting short with a good production quality. but as a ""vr film"" it doesn't offer much that you wouldn't get watching it flat screen.

this is treated more like a regular film than any other vr film i've seen with hard cuts, changing angles, pans, etc. it doesn't usually work that well because it either makes the viewer feel a bit queasy, confused after a huge scale change  or disoriented. other than taking in the environment there is little incentive to look around. the action is usually directly in front of the viewer. i felt more like i was a camera and not immersed in the world.

there is one shot i did really like where the two main characters climbed up a building each taking a different route. this was interesting because there were few cuts during this sequence allowing you to follow either of the protagonists. this can make for interesting vr storytelling and encourages rewatches to see areas you might have missed. i wish more of the film had been shot this way.

this is by far one of the most immersive vr games you can play. the launch was a little rocky from the wmr problems but the patch the team released only 13 hours after launch works perfectly. just wish there was maybe a check point system for the campaign; this can be problematic if you need to take a break when you use a wmr headset as it will go to sleep, closing the game as well, after 15 minutes. overall, worth the $33 (cad)

i also found that in my nearly 6 hour play session that the only time i felt sick was when i walked up some stairs sideways. guess i got some good vr legs seeing as a lot of people are complaining about it. if you're finding that you are feeling sick, i recommend also getting jet island. it's basically a shortcut for getting your vr legs; get used to moving at mach 2 and a bit of walking won't affect you anymore, at least for me anyways :)",1576030155,2,0,725105

"fun way to play solitaire on your expensive vr rig.

the gameplay mechanics are good, all the fun of playing with a real deck of cards, combined with the joy of not having to deal/shuffle them manually for each game.

not great for prolonged game sessions though as the height-adjustable table requires that you spend a lot of time looking downwards to see the cards, straining through the weight of the headset (vive) and the blurry edges of the lenses.

would be great to see more varied environments and perhaps the choice of a custom/workshop-powered skybox?

some improvements i'd suggest:

- allow the play table to angled in front of the user
- be more forgiving with throwing cards to the stacks at the top
- allow the deck to be repositioned so you don't have to stretch over the play area

"update: i purchase this game a second time, this time intending to play the game on an oculus rift s instead, since there are serious issues playing it on my oculus quest 2 (see the older part of the review below for details). when i tried running it on steamvr, the game stopped, with a popup telling me that only native mode is supported for the rift s. this defeats the purpose of me buying it on steam, as i already own it on the oculus store and i wanted to use my overlay programs, especially turn signal since i prefer to use physical turning rather than joystick turning.

refunded: if you have a quest 2, do not buy this game. unless the developers finally fix the control issues.

i have this game both standalone on my quest 2, and on pc via the oculus store. so i can confidently say, it's an absolutely amazing game. i was ready to drop another $50 for the deluxe edition because i prefer to play my vr games on steam, but unfortunately, the controls are completely broken for quest 2. this makes no sense, since it works like a charm on oculus pc and standalone quest 2.

some custom controls layouts exist on the workshop, but none work exactly right. notably, none seem to be able to toggle sprinting, and when i try to sprint by clicking in the left thumbstick, i sometimes stop being able to move at all. i'll consider purchasing again if the devs fix quest 2 touch support, otherwise i'd avoid getting it here and get it on the oculus store instead.",1619656656,2,0,742397

"(played on a valve index)

in it's current state, i can not recommend the game, and i don't think any updates will really solve a whole lot of the issues it has.

the only positive i can list is that the dialog feels... mostly on point. there's a lack of ""whimsical cynicism"" in sam and max's dialog, but more or less they do sound like the sam and max from past games.

other than that, here's the list of issues i kept having with it:

 - a severe lack of interactivity in the world that makes a point and click game look like an open sandbox, especially compared to past sam and max games.
 - sam and max don't look at each other when talking, giving a really awkward and unnatural look as they stare at you.
 - lack of detail and empty areas all over. it's a lot of walking and maybe the occasional hidden joke to find, but mostly nothing to interact with and get dialog out of sam and max.
 - poor rendering distances and often times aggressive geometry culling in spots with a clear line of sight. i had moments where whole buildings would straight up vanish when looking at them.
 - frustrating and uncomfortable to use vr controls. holding objects does not feel natural and requires you to aim them at awkward angles.
 - inconsistent puzzle mechanics, the bomb defusing ones were what made me give up due to either being unable to activate the correct mechanism, or accidentally setting the wrong one off as i go for the correct one.

 the game feels like a very early vr game where people were just barely getting the ropes on how to make a vr game, in a similar vein to when everyone wanted to add motion controls to their game back when the nintendo wii was popular. did this game need to be in vr? no, not really, but there are definitely ways to make a vr game feel justified with it's mechanics.

graphical issues aside, the game lacks the past sam and max charm, which isn't something you can easily patch in. in past games, there was a tremendous amount of dialog that was accessible around anything. every room was an adventure in of itself, and every object was guaranteed to have some witty line of dialog from the duo, some observable nihilistic joke that could be made.",1631557484,4,2,410040
"i like what i have played in the first ten minutes and both suprised and not suprised this is made by 2 people. great level of interactivity loved putting the fires out. the airlink stuttering when levels load is very jarring and it also stutters when rotating, however game works flawlessly after a couple of seconds. i would like to suggest subtitles if possible, and two handing the pistol. once the issue of stutters have been addressed, i will change my review to 5 stars. for the budget and price iam already impressed and i hope you can add to this game within a reasonable time frame.  you have a solid product just polish it up.",1651073520,5, ,316820

i have not tried multi-player.  even on easy on single player, the game was quite challenging for a noob like me to badminton.

"i really hope the devs see this. i¡¯m gonna write a long review of stuff that needs to be fixed and this game will be perfect.

first off the fielding is by far the most fun part of the game. very realistic , hard and in general lots of fun. however sometimes i don¡¯t understand why when i throw the ball my players just¡­ drop the ball. otherwise not much complaining on the fielding side of things.

pitching isn¡¯t horrible. it¡¯s okay. but that¡¯s it. it¡¯s really basic but you can still aim. you just have to throw the ball really awkwardly in an overhand motion or else the ball flies to saturn. i¡¯ll give them some leeway here cause the game is still new. i hope they polish the pitching mechanics so you can throw a couple different ways and with more of an arsenal rather than just a fastball.

batting needs a complete overhaul. it isn¡¯t fun and is very very wonky.  you have to hold your bat a a little over the plate and it isn¡¯t natural at all. not to mention it¡¯s very very buggy in general. i also have another complaint about batting that i will state later. also super sensitive. this just needs to be redone 

base running is okay as well. could be better. i wish you could steal or option when to send your teammates . i had a teammate in front of me one play and i tried to go to third but he wouldn¡¯t move. worst part is cpu didn¡¯t even throw me out. it was just a really awkward walk back to the base. i hope there¡¯s an added mechanic where you can at the very least send your guys. lastly here i feel like the cpu won¡¯t take bases on you for some reason. like it¡¯s predetermined how many bases they¡¯ll run.  i purposely held the ball in the outfield to see if a runner will go from 3rd to home  and they won¡¯t. which makes it feel much much more like i¡¯m playing cpu. although i suppose this issue will be fixed with multiplayer.

now i¡¯ll talk about the layout of the game. the graphics are good. i like them i think they fit and they work. however the commentary is a little bit annoying. the guys voice is overly obnoxious and while i could tolerate a little bit of it eventually it gets excessive and annoying.  i wish there was an option to choose between commentators or at least the option to turn him off .

lastly some bugs i noticed that nearly kill the game.

1.) for some reason i get extra runs, this is something that¡¯s happened occasionally but really ruins the game. i notice it happening when i hit a ground ball (this is the bug i was referring for batting ) and for some reason a run will be added to my score. which absolutely sucks. probably the number 1 bug that needs to be fixed

2.) i was down by one going to the last half of the inning in a game and preparing for my final 3 outs . simple. score one to tie or 2 to win. but then the game just ended¡­. it said i lost but i didn¡¯t even get to finish my last 3 outs. really annoying and anti climactic . this only happened once but if it can happen once i¡¯m sure it can happen again .

overall the game is good. it just needs touching up and with multiplayer being added this game would be amazing and easily become my favorite vr game. if i could i would give this game more of a 3.5 star rather than a 3. i¡¯m only slightly harsher because this game has a crazy amount of potential to be awesome and would be a huge waste if it wasn¡¯t done properly. but you guys are definitely on the right track",1627615414,5, ,271924

"i¡¯ve seen so many complaints about the update in the review section. and until i had the chance to try it my thoughts were that the developer had stolen my fitness partner and replaced it with some evil. 

gladly this is not the case, some people just don¡¯t like change.

firstly and most importantly, gone are the awkward boxing gloves that never seemed to be positioned as if they would be on my hands. along with this is the benefit of actually striking orbs when you feel you should be (naturally).

regarding the complaints i¡¯ve seen regarding the choice of environments, in boxvr your talking about two different floors and a very poor looking digital environment. hardly groundbreaking stuff.

now you have a workout area that feels like you are in the same building as the locker room. yet you have fantastic head on visibility of your streak, and score. no longer do you need to look left to see if you lost your streak.

you look down to see your power and velocity, on the right of you is your leaderboard position.

the lighting in the virtual environment is superb, with the shadows and effects when striking orbs (which in contrast with another reviewer cause absolutely no distraction to your next hit.)


this is a superb refinement of a fantastic fitness tool. i¡¯m sure many people who have complained have since come tk appreciate the improvements.

when you stopped playing like a child with your pure imagination?
maybe you wanted to keep doing it but it just wasn't fun anymore?
hurts right?

but now... now times are different. now i can do everything i did as a kid with my friends but just in vr with npcs.
it feels great to beat the crap out of people screaming for help.
it's so relaxing to cut off their limbs and punch other people with it.
impaling their heads and showcasing them on your front garden has never been so much fun.
and of course mods.
mods in this game make me feel so nostalgic. it's like back in the good old days when you invented a new game where you had so many advantages that it would be impossible for anyone to defeat you in your own game.

"in january 2018 i downloaded this game on my  samsung j3 for use with a cardboard or similar. (the game was free) despite the limitations, i managed to have a good amount of fun. it was my first 3d/vr experience, and was quite the influence; i got my oculus go later in the year, and here we are.

so first of all, this is the way emulated was meant to be played. it runs great, smoothest game in my library. unique, nostalgic visuals. retro-inspired first-person action. an arsenal of weapons. this game does an excellent job of catering to the sci-fi shooter crowd, and with a little help from oculus, (i could not read text or see any elements of the hud playing this on cardboard) emulated really makes you feel like a cyberspace warrior. i had a blast the first two levels - jumping over obstacles, blasting baddies and really just enjoying myself. i fumbled a bit with the controller but it did not hinder my experience.

that being said, emulated does not feature motion controls. i caught myself a few times trying to point my blaster as i had become accustomed to in games like dead and buried, or animov: vr combat. unfortunately for now, your weapon is stapled to the lower-right corner. however, as much as i adore detached 3dof aiming, i don't expect it to just be patched in (as lovely as it would be) so i'm not gonna be too sticky there. 

so, i blasted my way through levels one and two. level three: serious firepower. if you haven't paid attention till now, please do, because this is where it gets bad. see, emulated is supposed to be played with a gamepad, not the motion remote. with four functions on one circular touchpad (which controls your avatar)i was constantly switching weapons and pausing when i had no intention to. excusable, but frustrating. fast forward a bit and i got one pylon down. as i had gotten up to level five on cardboard i soon realized i missed a very powerful weapon that is essential later on. with a bit of exploring, i found it. two stories up. things are about to get hairy.

your character moves fast, notably so in tight spaces. jumping is done by clicking the top of the touchpad, meaning you can't jump in place, only sprint and leap. to make matters worse, for some reason during development the ability to move freely in midair was removed. you jump, you are stuck moving forward till you land. this was incredibly problematic when the game wanted me to jump on top of a box, then jump from the box to a platform. this took me about ten minutes of trial and error before i got my hands on my new toy. i continued, heavily put off, but determined to relive my first vr experience. unfortunately i did not make it far.

there soon comes a laser wall, which is deactivated with a button. the button can only be reached by pushing a similar box and repeating my last fumbling session but with a smaller target. keep in mind, you move fast. the box physics are wonky and you can't see where you're pushing it. this kind of puzzle works on pc for a few extra minutes of gameplay, but i ended up spending 35 minutes doing battle with not the evil vectorbots but with the games programming. this was so frustrating that after i finally got it i put my headset down and quit playing for several hours. the lack of 3dof is excusable, as is an understandably compact control scheme being problematic. and as much as i hope and pray the dev sees this and implement it, i would keep the controls and aiming just the way they are if i could just...move while falling. i am genuinely upset that i'm eating this 3 stars. i love emulated as much as ever, but the broken platforming is just that much of a deal breaker here. if you manage to survive the jumping puzzle, the following levels add lava. 


so, there's my piece. emulated has great potential, but in its current state, it just wasn't worth the last three dollars in my paypal. i had more fun with a phone strapped to my face than i did trying to use the go version. it saddens me, but until the jumping is fixed or at least until the controller can be remapped, this emulated is unfortunately a chore on the go. looks better, runs better, but it simply isn't enough. 

this title would be an instant five stars with motion aiming and a few physics tweaks. i'm sorry to rate emulated as two stars and i hope my feedback is heard, and if not at least considered for implementation, serves as productive criticism for future projects.

p.s. thank you for releasing this on android. had i not enjoyed it so much, i would never have upgraded to real vr. so, thanks for getting me into this awesome new way to play. good luck.",1536981814,5,"Thank you very much for such a great review. We are working on a new game from EMULATED series and we will take all the points that you mentioned into account.

"4/10

this game, on its own if you've never played boneworks will definitely appeal to you and by all means if you haven't played boneworks yet then maybe you could enjoy this game, but for me the fact that the main game is so short and it took me a few hours worth to beat the entire game is just a bit underwhelming and compared to boneworks, which had a much longer campaign as well as genuinely being more thrilling and provocative than what i've gotten out of bonelab really underwhelms me. in every other regard, it's simply an improvement from boneworks in some shape or form but i really don't feel like its a full product and although the main focus of the game definitely isn't just on the campaign i feel like its still not really appropriate to have the campaign be this short. in positive regards, michael wyckoff definitely knocked the ball out of the park with the soundtrack and the game is just as good as boneworks which means to someone who hasn't played boneworks this game will probably still feel amazing, but to me it just feels like so little compared to what it should've been.",1664660418,0,,123178077

"right let's address the problems with this first. i was playing using the meta quest 2. when i booted the game, it could not detect the motion controllers at all. the first 12 minutes of 'play-time' is me trying to figure out how to get the game to actually work. the fix was to go to the games properties and switch it to run in windows 7 mode. 
the next biggest gripe is i finished the story in less than an hour!! this is not really a game but more of a tech demo. of the 64 minutes at review time, 12 of those was trying to get the game to work. the story, is mediocre at best and not in line with the rest of the arkham games. 

the positives, it was fun looking in the mirror being batman and seeing the arkham knight car in vr has a much better sense of scale, it's just a shame you don't get to drive it in vr, or glide. seeing some of batman's enemies up close in vr gives them a more menacing feel and it was great, as was the art style. it gives me hope that the upcoming arkham shadow has real potential to be a great game. 

only buy this if it's on sale. if i had paid full asking price i would've felt ripped off.",1726479795,0,,175087231

"firstly, where is the door in the loft? am i trapped playing ping pong forever? haha

having played both ping pong vr experiences on steam, this one is easily the best. very realistic environment. the physics are almost spot on, and allowed me to do fast, pro shots with what almost felt like top-spin. the other game felt like a cheap gimmick compared to this.

haptic feedback on the vive controllers are pretty good but could be better. if valve can make a bow & arrow feel realistic then hopefully this dev can do the same with a ping pong bat :) either way, the other ping pong game does not have haptic feedback at all, so this is much better!

the difficulty levels of the ai are great, i managed to have a tough point-for-point match on the world class difficulty (and i get smashed on the difficulty above it, 'legendary'). i imagine even better players than i may want harder difficulties though.

the ai bat needs some swing animation when hitting the ball to make it feel a bit more realistic.

the environment is nice, the music is calming, the bed has been slept in. i am genuinely excited for more environments, say on top of a city skyscraper at night? the views would be fantastic and i would love to smash ping pong balls off the edge of a building and not worry about consequences!

i attempted the multiplayer component briefly, but a windows firewall prompt appeared on my desktop and i wasn't aware of it in the vr headset. only found out after stopping the game that that was why it wasn't working. i am sure it will work now that i have clicked allow on the prompt.

"i got this game for free :\ but it's fantastic!

using long sweeping motions to gather energy for your spells reminds me of firedancing. the hit/block mechanic is simple and intuitive, it just takes a bit of practice to get used to how exactly to fight.

first things first, this game is fun as hell. the immersion i got here was -battle wizard-, and sure. it is super early access. yes, it's just a simple arcade swinger (albeit a fun one). and yes (i feel) that even at this stage, it's worth 10 bucks for what it is. that being said the developer is very ambitious, and wants to add things like locomotion, and a world to play in.

casting spells requires one of four elements, you draw air by reaching up and literally 'grabbing' it with your hands, fire comes from head level, water from your torso, and earth from reaching down. each elements has a 'counter' element so you have to pay attention to what you're fighting, and how/what you are casting.

it can be quite a workout so be prepared to get physical. i'm really excited to see this game grow. its foundation, (fluid fighting), is captured so well that there are a number of different directions this game could go.

i have personally always seen vr as a niche market/fad as there are many problems plaguing what many enthusiasts would call ¡°the future of gaming¡±. while technology improves rapidly, the current tech suffers from being expensive, over-encumbering, and limited by certain facets of it¡¯s market. what i mean by limited is two things: one is that any headset you get will have some concerning negatives regarding a plethora of issues such as comfort, price, software/hardware issues, and tos (although tos pertains to oculus more than anyone). any headset will easily cost you over $300 and if you aren¡¯t fond of facebook, the price will easily go up to $600-$1000+. personally, i have a wmr headset which is very underrated and works just as well as any other, but i still had to spend $200 for it on ebay and microsoft doesn¡¯t really make a lot of these headsets anymore. the secondary thing that concerns me is that many don¡¯t develop for vr as it is so niche leaving the market in a dry spell of no real titles to play. the thing with any hardware is that it can¡¯t exist or thrive without good software. i¡¯ve scoured vr titles before but nothing ever really stood out to me other than the standard beat saber, pavlov, and vrchat, and i think that while those are great, they tend to get old over time. but then comes half-life:alyx.

the half-life series hasn¡¯t even been my favorite series as i only like the 1998 original and couldn¡¯t finish the sequel, but alyx has me wanting to go back because alyx is just that good. regular games have always been hard for me to ¡°immerse¡± myself in and i was skeptical that vr wouldn¡¯t put a dent in that, but whenever i was playing alyx, i found myself to be somewhat immerse because of the polish that valve put into it. the environments are stunning even at low fidelity, the atmosphere in the game really has no competition, the journey of the game is fantastic, and it is all in vr for you to look around and take in with the feeling that you are somewhat there and involved constantly interacting with the world. you are rewarded for exploring these environments with additional tools and supplies to aid you in your journey and it never feels like a disaster to slog through because of the well implemented features of the game.

combat is also something that takes a turn in vr. you have to manually reload your weapons when under threat of a huge combine soldier or when you¡¯re getting swarmed by zombies while using the environment to your advantage. i¡¯ve done this a couple times like peeking around corners and above counters to try and get shots off on an enemy or picking up an item in the game that i can use as a shield against bullets. there¡¯s a section where numerous headcrabs are jumping towards you in an area you can¡¯t really dodge them in, so what i did was grab a t.v. set and carry it in front of me as some sort of diy shield where the headcrabs would simply hit it and fall afterwards. [spoiler]and god, the grenade launcher you get for the shotgun is freaking fantastic in combat situations.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]and the freaking jeff chapter. that was a glorious section where you had to physically cover your mouth to prevent coughing so he wouldn¡¯t hear you and manipulate objects around the environment to lure him with sound or do things very quickly. i even found out that you can find a gas mask lying about somewhere in the chapter and equip it onto alyx by putting it on your face, thus making you immune to the coughing from the spores as you go throughout the level giving you a slight advantage over the invincible jeff.[/spoiler]

there are some pitfalls with this game as any game this large and ambitious is bound to have problems. i¡¯ve experienced problems regarding performance with my cpu/gpu as this game is a beast to run taking up nearly 95% of my processing power on a 3070 and a i5, but this is easily fixed by setting priority in task manager. just don¡¯t expect to stream on discord or anything if your computer isn¡¯t built well. the only other problem i¡¯ve had is the game randomly closing, although i¡¯m not sure if this is because something is wrong with the game or something external is conflicting like the wmr portal required to launch for steamvr. i could get into my opinions on the story but anything i have is minor nitpicks and not really consider a ¡°pitfall¡±. not to mention, i think it¡¯s worth the gameplay alone which is why i won¡¯t get into the story or discuss it but the story is great for what it offers to regular vr players and half life fans. 

some of the minor nitpicks i mentioned are spoilers so be warned.
-sometimes items like clips and grenades will get stuck in the environment or just plain disappear into the ground.

-throwing things sometimes is a pain as it doesn¡¯t go where you want resulting in you hitting your ceiling fan again.

[spoiler]-the ending part concerning the artillery turret you control is somewhat difficult to operate personally speaking. also, the energy balls you get at the end section are also somewhat of a nuisance to throw as well.[/spoiler]

-the hacking mini game with the sphere sometimes can¡¯t be visible due to the lighting in the game. it can also freak out and move on you causing you to lose your place, but i fear this is a controller tracking issue more or less. also i really wish the prompt to use the multi-tool would disappear after i¡¯ve already done the mini game so many times.

-also, these hacking mini games or even opening a door can sometimes result in a crash or a glitch i had happen where my vr was completely shut off, but i could still hear game audio and have access to my controls. 

the only other negative thing i can think of is if vr was the right choice for a game/series many had been waiting for. it is unfortunate that some will not get to play alyx because of their stances on vr or because of their finances because vr is expensive and is seen as an investment rather than something that will pay off in the long run. again, vr¡¯s problems concerning lack of use among normal consumers and it¡¯s niche market stem from a lack of quality software that warrants a purchase of a headset to experience the few titles that make it great. lots think ports are the way to go and slap a vr edition of their game out when it wasn¡¯t built for it which then equates to a lack of people buying it and therefore less development, either because it¡¯s poorly designed for the genre or is something that¡¯s already been experienced not through a miniature t.v. strapped to your face being sold for a high price. but it also comes the other way around as you can also experience alyx through a mod that makes it to where you can play without the use of a vr headset, but then you have to question if you are getting the experience valve tailored to you or not being the vr experience. 

all in all, alyx is a solid vr title and with valve enabling the workshop on the game as well as giving the community source 2 tools, i can¡¯t wait to see what we get in terms of mods or games made from these tools. if you can get vr for very cheap and are interested in it, then i fully recommend this game without a second doubt in my mind. although, don¡¯t make the mistake of buying a premium headset because you want a premium experience. that¡¯s not to say you can¡¯t, but give other headsets a look first and do research as i don¡¯t think vr is worth the investment of $500 and over personally. my wmr has better specs than the oculus rift s and performs fine for $100 cheaper. just don¡¯t run out and get a index willy nilly unless you just have that cash to throw around. even then consider the titles you¡¯ll be playing because in my opinion, there aren¡¯t many out there as well designed as alyx. thanks valve.",1612817426,3,0,532450

runesage is one of those games i stumbled across, and must say, is an absolute gem. the idea of the game is to explore the realm and find crystals, using spells to help you traverse obstacles. spells are unlocked as you progress through the game, and like all good exploration games, the game has you returning to older locations because when you unlock new spells it can change your perspective on an old environment; areas you never thought were not accessible before suddenly become within reach thanks to your magic.

the spellcasting is just fun. spells are cast by drawing out shapes in the air with a wand. it has a really satisfying harry potter feel to it that i enjoy. unlocking new spells is exciting because each of the spells are very cool, and i found there was no spell in the game that becomes obsolete, so even later in the game i found i was still using my good old initial knock spell to unlock doors. best of all, spells can be combined something like magicka, so for example a water spell combined with a wind spell will give you a jet of water, that could be necessary to solve a puzzle. every now and again drawing out the spell can be a bit niggly, but i found that if you draw the shape smaller it seems to register better.

i wouldn't say the game is difficult, because there is nothing in it that is flat out hard to do, but it is tricky. there are puzzles that range from feats of dexterity and speed, to puzzles that require perception, and a little tinkering around with the environment. i've definitely hit walls and gotten lost, but this is one of those games that when you do figure out what to do next it makes you feel smugly satisfied. something critical to point out about this game is that there are no monsters, no dangers and no pressures. this is not a first person shooter, not a wave defender, or even a dungeon crawler, this is pure atmospheric exploration and puzzle solving, and honestly with the vr market being swamped with shooters, this is what makes runesage stand out for trying something a little outside the box. while not exactly like the game myst, i think the vibe of myst is a good way to think about the gentle tone and pace of this game.

graphically, the game is nothing special. the textures are pretty good but where it falls flat is the lack of tessellation in the environments. so for example, you might see a door and it looks awesome, but on closer inspection you can see the door is just a texture wrapped around a flat rectangular polygon. but that said, don't be fooled into thinking the simple graphics will somehow detract from your enjoyment of the game. there are also nicely varied environments such as forests, caves and really spooky underground labyrinths.

in terms of sound, sounds effects are fairly straight forward and relatively sparse, with no voice acting in the game other than the names of each spell as you unlock them. i don't know if it was a design choice, but the sparsity of sound and lack of voice, combined with the fact that you are just wandering around exploring leads to really a solitary experience. i've read other users on the forum as describing the game as quite lonely feeling, and it's weird but i actually agree. i don't dislike that though, and i think it gives the game a certain uniqueness to its tone. the music in the game is lovely, ranging from celtic style folk music to creepy gregorian chants.

for the controls in this game, i give this developer and a++. seriously, for any developer who is struggling with movement in their game, i am going to point them towards this game as a shining example. so why is it so good? customization. just about every vr control scheme is in there, plus the amazing option to further tweak them until they are perfectly tailored to you. hate teleporting? no problem, there is a trackpad. wanna use arm swing? look to move or onward style? left handed, right handed, push to toggle or hold. right down to being able to tweak the speed of movements, this game has just about everything to make it as comfortable as possible for the player. and for that reason, despite being a free movement game, i rate this as one of the most comfortable vr experiences i've had. to the developer, seriously.. well done.

it's worth noting runesage is still in early access right now, but i've put 8 hours into it so far and it feels pretty solid. i'm definitely interested to see what more is gonna be added; personally i'd love to see the environments continue to be padded out to make them even more immersive. on the higher tier of scope, it would be amazing if there was more interactivity with clutter objects in the world. oftentimes there are rooms with books and scrolls on tables, but you can't actually pick anything up or knock them over. other than that, one feature i would love would be if there was in-game notepad that you could either type or draw in. the game reminds me so much of old school paper and pen exploration games that there were times when exploring that i really wanted to draw a map as i walked or make reminder notes of interesting things, but didn't want the hassle of taking off the headset to literally draw in a paper notepad. i just think it could be cool if something like this existed in-game.

final thought, the price of $10 is perfect, and very reasonable for what the game already has to offer. so if you are looking for a chill, exploration and puzzle experience, i recommend runesage highly.",1505938897,3,0,521693

"i was initially hesitant to give this a thumbs down, because i did manage to have fun, despite the laundry list of issues below. however, you'll see at the end of the review why i'm no longer hesitant. i posted the following in the game's forum under the title ""constructive feedback from the dev"":

[quote=nantes]i bought this to play with a friend. here's a breakdown of the several problems i encountered in my first 2 hours of gameplay:

* getting items dropped from the floor can be really awkward, i kept accidentally grabbing items from my belt instead. the belt's grabbing area is way too large. this, more than any other issue, annoyed me tremendously and made me feel i should probably refund and invest my money on a game that doesn't feel so janky.
i have since gotten used to it and i barely have a problem with it anymore, but that's because i had to adjust myself to the game's quirks. it shouldn't have to be like this.
suggestion: being able to grab items from the floor by simply pointing your hand at them and pressing a key, then the item is magnetized to your hand. that's what most other vr games do.

* getting items/arrows from your back is extremely inconsistent, the grabbing area seems to be way too small, in contrast with the belt's too-large one. so much so that i forgo my back altogether and pretend i only have 3 items slots! my friend also agreed with this assessment multiple times.

* during the tutorial you have to attack an enemy to test your melee weapon. the enemy was clipping through the floor and only the top of its head could be seen. i had squat down to be able to hit it. my friend confirmed this happened to him too.

* the magic book's tutorial text said the book has two attacks, but i couldn't for the life of me figure out how to do the second attack. it was only by sheer chance much later that i found out you have to keep charging the attack for like 7 seconds, which feels waaaay too long. no other game in living memory expects you to charge an attack for that long.

* enemies glitch out a lot when attacking with melee, they will seemingly freeze for a moment, and in the next moment you're already damaged without even having seen the attack. really awkward.

* other players can accidentally grab your equipment from your hands. my friend accidentally grabbed the shield i was using and i ended up dying because of it.

* many rooms contain absolutely nothing and are simply short corridors that lead to the next room. why have these rooms? why not simply take the player directly to the next room, bypassing this completely useless buffer?

* that room on the outside of the dungeon consisting of a long bridge that zigzags has some ""secret"" areas where you can go under the bridge by crossing some fallen stone columns... but this alternate route seems to offer no rewards whatsoever, and in fact triggers a trap that shoots homing balls of light at the player. what's the point? you're punishing the player for exploring when you should be rewarding them.

* rooms sometimes have several exit doors, but several of them are locked. what's the point? this just needlessly annoys the player.

* when you finish a dungeon, you get graded in your mini-boss, vitality and stealth with ""passed"" or ""failed"" marks. i don't think the game actually explains how to pass those grades. in one dungeon, we killed a bunch of mobs instantly before they detected us, but we still failed stealth. in another, even though we clearly had killed a boss, it still failed us! (we did go through another door instead of the one that had a skull on top of it after killing the boss. we had to do quite a bit more of the dungeon before finishing it. maybe that's why, we took the ""wrong way""?)

* investing points in skills give really weird downsides. increasing your strength for example makes you slower. but wait, isn't strength supposed to make you be able to carry weight more effectively? if anything, it should increase your speed and/or max weight capacity. it would make a lot more sense if strength simply reduced your magic damage, then separate strength's health bonus into a separate skill called vitality so that it doesn't punish magic users who want to be less squishy.

* i somehow have the axe rifle and sniper rifle (from the blackmark chests) already unlocked despite never having gotten a blackmark chest (only 4 blackmark coins), and my friend who has 5 coins does not have the sniper unlocked. how were they unlocked?

* the axe rifle is extremely glitchy: most often, when trying to load it, or even randomly in the middle of loading it, the player character will start holding the rifle with both hands instead, interrupting the loading. it was so bad that i decided not to use it.

despite all of the above, i did manage to have fun with my friend, so in the end i decided not to refund it, taking into account that this is developed by a single person. but damn me if it doesn't feel like a pre-alpha!!!![/quote]

since then, someone posted claiming that some of these issues were pointed out 3 years ago and they're still present, and i have tried karnage chronicles which is such a vastly, vastly, vastly more polished dungeon-crawling experience that they're not even remotely on the same league! i urge you, dear reader, to go try that game first so that you have some perspective to evaluate this one. you'll see the difference is night and day.",1594298365,3,0,578451

however magic and ranged combat is amazing. bow feels about the same as the bow you can use in oculus home.

"[h1]experienced on windows mixed reality[/h1]

you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/2rh0n2rfvw4

i'm giving this a neutral recommendation. i would describe this as a walking simulator / exploration game. it sort of reminded me of gone home ... a poor man's gone home. there just isn't much depth here. while the game is narrative driven, the narrative is paper thin. 

really, it's mostly finding keys to unlock doors or finding hidden picture frames to place in a container. i found the core gameplay loop to be tedious and uninspired. a good walking simulator will have simple, but meaningful interactions that make you feel like part of the story. looking for the hidden keys / picture frames just makes you want to get out asap. 

the best part of this experience is actually the two mini-episodes playing on the tvs in vr. warning: one of them only plays half of it and after you advance the game, you can see the second half of the episode. so be careful to watch both halves as they start looping and make you think there isn't more to the story. 

this game is running on the unity engine. you have full locomotion and snap turning. you have a comfort vignette on by default, so once you start the game, just pause and you can turn it off in the settings (you can't turn it off at the start menu). the game was running at a steady 90 frames per second on my 1060 gtx.

it only costs $5 usd and i got it on sale for $4 usd. i'm not sure it's worth it though. maybe if you have nostalgia for cheap episodes inspired by the twilight zone series i can recommend it for you.

[b]rate 5/10.i would have preferred to have watched the tv mini-episodes on youtube. they are the only reason i'm giving this game a neutral recommendation, instead of a negative one. [/b]",1596086246,3,0,396126

"this is not your typical archery game at all. this is more of a strategy top-down 3d board game where you place tiny characters and watch them. you can also control one of the characters, but doing so is pretty lame in my opinion. for one thing, you cannot move at all in this game. and i found using the bow very awkward with the arrow not always connecting smoothly with the bow.  this game also does not work properly with the index controller, because the bow always ends up in your right hand. you can shoot the enemies with arrows or magic as they run in a single path, but they do not react until the final shot when they die. i also encountered lots of consistent frame rate drops and there is no option menu i could find to adjust the graphic settings. every map also looks the same. this early access game is clearly unfinished and has obviously been abandoned by the developer. i cannot recommend this game.",1623516195,3,0,702140

"this. this game.
i played it with a friend of mine and i must say we had only good things to say. it was very skill-based so it was hard at first but as time went on i became better, for instance with the bow. picking the archer class was a long shot (pun intended) considering i'm kinda bad at games but after a while i got really good at seeing the angle and arch i had to shoot at, and hitting targets even at longer distances. besides that, there were a few more basic pros and cons:

pros:
- skill-based combat and progression
- monsters are genuinely hard to kill, not like the typical ""hurr durr hit it till it dies"" that you see in a lot of similar games
- ai was pretty good for things like dodging, ducking, and putting up the shield. made the enemies feel real
- graphics are *stunning.* even on my gtx 970, ran like a dream with no lag that i noticed.
- the hit system. the hit system, the hit system. the way you have to actually swing your blade really made close-quarters combat a lot more entertaining.
- when playing co-op you have to compete for money, which makes it like a race every time an enemy is killed

cons:
- movement is a little clunky at first, but after getting used to it it's basically unnoticeable.
- story is hard to care about (though they very nicely added a skip button on all the dialogue)
- multiplayer lobbies were a little hard to make or join, but once one was set up it was fine
- some weird bugs. for instance, when i tried to go back to lobby the first time, i got a black screen that persisted for several minutes until i killed the game. never happened again.

anyway, this game is worth its storage space in gold. i'd recommend it to anyone looking at it, please do buy it, it is exactly as good as it looks. best example of a ""hidden gem"" i've seen in a while.",1615346366,3,0,598658

"decent. repetitive. boring after my second playthrough (in which i beat the game...... :x)

the game is a good idea. unfortunately the starting pistol is 800% better than any other weapon, all of which are 'supposed' to be more powerful, except for the fact that they all require you to do reloading movements (rail gun is a fail)... they fall short.  sorry devs, but for an action based game, no one wants to spend 2-5 seconds reloading a gun that's barely better than the infinite ammo starting pistol that doesn't require you to do anything to reload it.

and if you make the original pistol require a reloading mechanism, you've ruined the game. 

the game should be arcade-action just like everything else about it entails. ditch the reload mechanisms on the weapons and just make the game arcade-action, like it should be. 

oh, and.... its a roguelike. add more powerups. check binding of isaac for ideas if you don't get what i mean.

"after playing the game for 20 hours now, i still believe this is the single best vr game on the market, it is fun and intuitive for new vr users and still manages to feel familiar like the half life 2 we know and love. 
undeniably their are some holes that will need to be smoothed over in the plot, like: why have we never seen russell afterwards in the timeline. why does alex make no mention of the grabbity gloves etc.
those who go into this desperate for a bit of expansion of the plot will get this satisfied towards the later chapters with most of the new story being in the final chapter and cut scene. 
this does not take away from the game one bit and i feel is representative of valve's attitude to the series - dipping their toes in the water of the old half life universe whilst making the rest of the game fairly ambiguous. to gauge the response before making a game that is entirely focused on furthering the story rather than expanding the world.
overall the gameplay was well and truly half life; adding twists and spins on classic problems for vr.
and in addition it looked beautiful all the way through.

*spoilers*
valve treated us to 13 seconds of half life 3 in the post credit scene, and on paper this sounds disappointing, but it was so good i simply cannot complain. i love the way they have remodelled the g-man to look like his half life 1 counterpart, whether this is the intention or otherwise, i think it makes him look more human with these features. 

my only complaint about the game is the lack of atmospheric variance. the post-credit scene in the hangar looked 10x more beautiful than the already beautiful game. i imagine this likely to being in an industrious environment throughout the whole playthrough - that slight change twigged your ear into looking harder again at how marvellous your surroundings are. 
2 models i didn't expect to look so good were the advisors and dog. 

finally, i encountered a couple of crashes throughout my playthrough, nothing i couldn't manage.
i must highlight that i was playing this game for 3+ hours at a time from day 1 before any sort of update was released and i was probably putting a lot of strain on my hardware. 

*spoilers over*

i cannot stress enough how stunning this game is, the community reaction has been magnanimous, tyler mcvicker crying at his ending was truly touching.

in true valve fashion, a cliffhanger was amended with a cliffhanger - we've waited 13 years thus far.
i believe that this next period of waiting will be a lot more painful than this however. 

i cannot wait to see the plot progress, i hope valve does not relapse into another 13 year hibernation.
and i hope that this game is the green light the company need to keep making more single-player story games. they are the best at them.

p.s 
you know i'm credible because i've explored almost every inch of the game - you can tell by my having 100% achievements. *subtle flex*",1585670630,2,0,550528

i'll be honest there is quite a bit of jank, but considering this is a mod and it is free and let's be honest there was jank in the original game especially with ladders (which is just a problem in source games in general).

playing this mod makes me really want to see this game completely overhauled and built from the ground up for vr like half life alyx. half life 2 is a masterpiece, but it is a game from 2004. it is still holding up pretty well for its age, however, it would be a much more immersive experience to see this game with 2022 graphics. i would love for a complete remake of half life 2 and the episodes all built from the ground up for vr. i know that is far beyond the scope of what is ever going to be offered from this mod team, but it would be amazing to have all of the half life series playable in vr with the same graphics or better than half life alyx.",1663385721,0,,122354396
"i enjoy this and i am excited to see where they go with future updates. however, if playing offline, the first one is a more polished experience. some key differences:
-there are currently no melee weapons available.
-guns are extremely uncommon loot items, and a rifle is not unlocked until security level 2. this took about 6 in game hours to accomplish. this meant for 6 hours, i was primarily using a double barrel shotgun against enemies with automatic weapons or sniper rifles.
-there is one type of food, but eating does nothing.
-the loot for hard fights is not as rewarding as the first game, and i find myself generally struggling with money. part of my issue with money has come from bugs with the store, with the most critical loss being around 3k credits.
-there is no weapon maintenance (but based on the reference to maintenance, this will be added)
-there are currently no real difficulty setting changes that can be made. you get what you get.
-a ton of very noticeable bugs (floating ammo, disappearing money, items not registering as being in your inventory)

while not as good as the first game in its current state, i fully trust this developer. the first game felt like an entirely different game by the end of development in the best possible way. if you want to support the developer but are looking for a more polished experience, i would recommend playing the first game and checking in on this one as development continues.",1721861647,0,,170663853

as a vr port, it helps with the immersion and terror that the character experiences.  i didn't have any motion sickness, but i have strong vr legs.  

while there isn't really any replay incentive (and honestly some of the more terrifying portions i wouldn't want to replay), i would gladly purchase this game again, if not to share in the life of others who are afflicted with mental illness.",1599449238,0,0,697101

"amazing game. usually when i see a lesser known vr game that intrigues me on steam i wait a while to see how many reviews it gets and if they are positive. either that or until it starts to get a lot of buzz on reddit. i decided to grab this , because it had caught my attention several times since it was released a few days ago in the new releases tab. it looked like a ton of fun.

i am so glad i decided to grab it. this game is a little different than i thought it would be i thought you would have to swing your arms and pull yourself to each platform. the control scheme works different than that though, you use your hands to grab and position within your view, and your head to control the direction you jump / fly in. i suspect this is how they reduced nausea despite the fact that this is a very fast paced title. its an amazing interpretation of a platformer in vr. the control scheme and locomotion is not something i would consider as hampering the game even though it was different than i thought it would be, unlike some titles where you wish the locomotion/ control schemes didnt get bogged down by the developers trying to illeviate motion sickness i did not feel that with this game.

the game itself has a good amount of content over 30 levels i believe and tons of replayability. you will certainly not master these levels on your first play through. there are secret routes you can take and collectibles on each level not to mention level times , which is where i think most of my replayability will come in, trying to complete levels as fast as i can to not only get medals for faster completions (which unlock new levels) but hopefully to compete on leaderboards. i will attest that i did not notice any leaderboards on my playthrough of the first 14 levels but if they are not there i imagine it is something that will be added when the dev adds multiplayer in the future (something they have said they will do)

this game is not climbey, it is much more fast paced. its more like a parkour game with jetpacks. highly suggest it for almost anyone. i am generally not into these types of games as much but this one intrigued me enough to give it a try, and i dont regret it.

edit: i have a few criticisms though after playing a little while longer. during my first play through i was happy to go from level to level just trying every level out, but now for example if i dont get the right time on a level there doesnt seem to be a menu option once your actually in the game. to either restart the level or to go back to the main menu. your actually kind of stuck in the infinite loop of going level to level until you decide to quit the game and restart it to get back to the main menu as far as i can tell. i have pressed every button on the controllers to no avail when it comes to finding a menu. this seems like a serious design flaw, in a game where posting fast times is important either resetting mid level if you screw up to many times or even deciding to replay the level if you just missed the time you wanted would be important features., and they are missing from to the top. i still recommend this game, but tbh the lack of this feature alone put a pretty big damper on my experience.",1495434902,2,0,507990
"you need to mod this game if you are thinking about getting it. modding it is super simple so don't worry.

pros
-just a fantastic game. tops all other games of it's genre.
-super original idea (or at least i haven't seen anything like this before it came out)
-a must-have for vr
-great for working out when you don't really have the room and/or am a little chubby like myself (not a workout replacement!)

cons
-only comes with a handful of songs that aren't really that good or fun to play (unless you mod it)
-great songs locked behind a paywall as dlc (again, unless you mod it)
-can be quite demanding on pcs
-i believe there is in fact a warning but there are a lot of quick flashing lights in the base-content. i am not someone who gets affected by this but even i had to pause it for a second.

overall, definitely purchase this game! but mod the hell out of it as if you are bob ross with a wet paint brush to get your moneys worth.",1595546239,0,0,629648

"time and time again valve proves that they are absolute masters of their craft. this game is worthy of the insane levels of hype that the prospect of half-life 3 has conjured. it's an experience, like going to disneyland. it's something on a whole different level than any game before. it's crazy that i can experience something like this without leaving the house. i assume valve is going to send me some exorbitant bill or something.

how the hell is something like this available at the consumer level?

i can't describe this game well enough, no one can. it'd be like describing a dream or a drug - you'd think i'm lying or exaggerating. you have to experience it for yourself to understand.

i once regarded vr to be like the wii (though way more insane than motion controls). it's fun and new, but not the future of gaming. this is one of the first vr games that made me feel like this is the beginning of a whole new world of gaming. this is a similar feeling to playing that first 3d game. it's crazy to think we'll look at this sort of tech as being ancient someday.

this game also has one of the best endings of all time. this isn't a spin-off or anything. if it wasn't in vr this would still be up there with games like half-life 2 and portal 2. for the love of god though, don't watch this on a flat screen on youtube or something. it won't do the vr experience justice.

[spoiler]it also finally advances the story by like...10 seconds. but it's a damn sweet 10 seconds and also half-life 3 confirmed. valve is so next level that the only way they could have announced half-life 3 was at the end of a revolutionary, groundbreaking game. jesus christ.[/spoiler]

if you are giving any of the harsh reviews much credit, tsk tsk. especially at this price, this game is a steal!!! more promise than prom pussy! the developer is very responsive and i love being able to give input as it grows.. absolutely worth the price tag! 

the movement controls are extremely customizable! you can teleport, you can run around free. and much more fine tuning to find that zen zone for your brute bashing. only note on that is whatever effects are in place for motion sickness are not helping me. if i would only use teleport i think it would be  better on the ms.

visually this game is pretty but simple. nothing is fancy but given the early acess and amazing time and effort put into the weapon mechnics and way everything works together.. i cannot complain. i would rather thus type of game be functionally satisfying over visual pleasing.

the melee fighting is well done, the bow is adequete for a multi-weapon game like this, the tool belt works perfectly.  the ai won't run up on you but they are also smart enough to not let you mow them down with a bow without trying to dodge or put a shield up.

the story never gripped me, but that's not what i'm playing this for anyway.

the fantasy adventure was amazing.  i love goign through dungeons holding a torch and swapping to a sword and shield when a skeleton approaches and then ducking behind walls and firing out arrows in room scale.

"this game combines the button-clicking cockpits of dcs, with the fun-to-play nature of all those flightsims you played growing up, with the what-a-time-to-be-alive amazingness of vr. 
the haptic feedback of the controls is perfectly done.  the vtol flight model is user-friendly enough to be fun and tricky enough to be even more fun.  the graphics are simplistic but gorgeous (with super-smooth frame-rates). 
and all at half the cost of a dcs aircraft, 

for an early-access game there are suprisingly few (if any) issues.  couple of things i'd like to see (beyond the additional content already underway), if possible:
- ability to pause in-game
- allow oculus users to use extended index finger to toggle buttons (without trigger press)
- ability (or instructions) to use own music in-cockpit
- option to use hotas controls (although this is very low priority for me)",1501978871,3,0,681219

"i think this game is definitely one of the better games for oculus. when you wander around the several available maps, it¡¯s almost nonstop action, and you can always keep yourself entertained with looting, killing zombies, and testing out new weapons. honestly, although it¡¯s expensive, it¡¯s well worth the money. the graphics are pretty good for a vr game, and i¡¯ve got over 10 hours on it, and am still going.

pros:
-spaced out, you¡¯ve got over 7 hours of main quest. 
-great graphics.
-two different gamemodes to keep you entertained.
-trial mode is nonstop action, and you get to test out a number of weapons.
-each different section of the map has a lot of area to explore.

cons:
-on the more expensive side of games.
-a fairly large game, and it takes ik a good chunk of storage.
-on the oculus quest, the boundary can get in the way when you step outside of it.

pros : 
+ intuitive and natural control that works. dribble, crossover, shoot, jump shoot, lay up, dunk, you can do it all in vr. 
+ graphic is cartoony but okay. it still nice and quite representative.

cons 
+ learning curves. you need to get used to the control scheme. it's quite good but it still takes time to learn before you could play like lebron or dribbling like the professor 

feedback
+ it would be nice if the dev could add physical jump setting to trigger the jump and power jump mechanic in the game, so you can jump naturally to do dunk, lay up, or jump shoot. pressing buttons to jump is awkward and unnatural especially for a basketball player",1650437774,2,0,428021

"as of today, (3rd of june 2017), i have played a full day of this game, so i wanted to write a review.

before the actual review, a quick little fyi: i actually bought vive for this game, especially this game.

so, pros...:

+ great graphics
+ nice maps
+ the attention to detail is amazing
+ lots and lots of weapons to play with (and more are being added with each update!)
+ no need for a calibration, nor any struggles with changing to left handed 
  (i am left handed, so this is more of a personal +)
+ the developer has a nice devblog, communicates with the community and is a nice guy in general
+ all the content is a part of the core game, so no 100s of dlcs (looking at you payday)
+ great community
+ a comfortable handling of all the weapons

...and cons:

- yes, the weapons are very detailed, but certain ""kewl"" things (such as the m4's forward assist) instead of being pulled, are just set to a button (again, kind of a personal one)
- for newbies, knowing what button does what can be difficult, but this is just a minor one, as it should stop being difficult during the first 1-3 hours
- on the map ""friendly 45 range"" sometimes occur small fps drops (especially when scoping) , at least for me, (so again, a bit of a personal one), but this is a very minor one, as it dissapears after a while

but all things aside, this game is a masterpiece for the vr, and even though it has a lot of things, it is very well optimized (i have a 970 and it runs like a dream, but that is with most of vr titles, at least the popular ones,) very well made and the dev is just amazing.

i give it a solid 9.9/10 - if you have a 970 or better, a semi-good cpu (lower gen i7 should be alright), like guns in general, and have the money to buy a vive, then don't hesitate and just buy this game.",1496517136,0,0,475300

only thing i will note: if you have a small space for your vr you will need to spend some additional time getting used to the turning mechanic as well as the teleport mechanic. i ended up having to sit inside the middle of the table on the bigger maps so i could reach everything in my particular setup. i had no problems doing that and the game allows you to do that nicely i just had to spend a few extra minutes and orient myself in the maps before i started the waves.",1540768137,3,0,521822

"completing the game took around 6 hours, occasionally stopping to look for hidden items. very replayable and enjoyable, gotta (catch) collect 'em all! physics can get a bit glitchy sometimes but not unplayable or bad. it's relatively dependable but you won't make it one playthrough without at least a few small physics glitches.

getting out of the main hub was the biggest struggle. first you have to wander around not knowing what to do. it makes you interact with at least 3/6 alternate game modes before continuing the first good half of the story, all tied up in some physics puzzle thing. though it is just another puzzle in a physics puzzle adventure sandbox game. it introduces you to other fun stuff, not too bad in my opinion as you don't even really have to play each one. it's more along the lines of interacting with each menu and maybe pressing play then returning back to the hub.

as for good (spoiler-free) story-related things, the character swap feature is one of the most impressive and mind-blowing experiences. just to see how large the world can look from a small creature's eyes, or how small everything looks from a huge character. two-handed weapons can look like the size of a hatchet from a large enough character. amazing stuff! 

the story itself was a bit more fleshed-out than boneworks, but i don't feel like the story meant enough in the end. no satisfying or surprising moments or anything. just fun random gameplay similar to boneworks. i'll probably appreciate the lore a lot more when the big theory videos come out on youtube after they data mine the game, and as i accumulate more hours searching for hidden items and clues. until then it leaves me with more questions than answers.

boneworks left me with this spine-chilling, almost scary ending with so many unknown things like the dangerous void and the mystery of it all. though i originally couldn't grasp the story, bonelab is a bit more understandable, but not bone-chilling or even close to that scary feeling. it's a different experience, but i'd definitely recommend playing for at least a few hours to appreciate the tech and possibly the uprising of a new community of modding and endless fun.

as for graphics, the biggest difference from different graphics settings to me was the lag, so if you have framerate issues it might not be a big deal to change it. also the loading sometimes gets kinda janky where it'll freeze and take a few mins to load a level. i play on an hp reverb g2 and controls worked right from the start.

i haven't uploaded anything to the game yet, but the idea of creating custom characters and maps for others to play sounds great if it'll catch on. being released to the widely popular oculus (meta) quest 2 vr headset, it has as good of a chance as it ever could.",1664672975,0,,123186503
"this is a fantastic game! i'm sure you can see from other reviews, it is very ""black & white"" minus a creature (which i don't mind). you get 6 levels to play, each with an exponential increase in difficulty. (i just beat level 4, and the time attack is just ""finish the level""). 

my only complaint is i would like to see difficulty settings (but only because i actually want a sandbox mode). it can be deflating after building a great little village and almost completing an objective, only to hit the 10 minute mark and have to start all over. :( :( :(

i'm a huge fan of city builders and this application of vr really nails it. hopefully we can get a huge island and sandbox mode to just transport into, away from reality, and make the perfect tribe.

super island god is the most immersive vr game i have played yet, and i attribute it to the ""flying"" movement mechanics, instead of teleport-to-move mechanics. however, for this reason, i don't recommend this as your very first vr game, as the flying can be very nauseating until you get used to vr. 


it is early access, so it has its quarrels:

~the food rate info also seems broken/non-intuitive, possibly will get fixed soon?
~stutters a little on the 970, but is extremely immersive and great for it's price.

also i recommend changing your chaffeur colour to red or something else dark, as i bumped into a lot of things while playing this because the default colour dissapears into the friendly island colour scheme.


tl;dr : best vr game i've played, fly to move (not teleport), only 10 minutes of play per level (then you lose), needs a sandbox mode (or not 10 minutes), very fun god sim (like black & white).",1479856729,0,0,521521

"whilst the game itself has an enjoyable combat system, there isn't really much else on offer here. the ""story"" is wave-based combat that switches to wave-based combat with points to defend about 5 missions in. it can be beaten with relative ease. there's no options for anything like subtitles that i could find anywhere in any options menu, so the story itself which is delivered as narration over all the fighting can be hard to hear and understand.

there's also not been any notable updates to the game in a year or so, as proven by the fact that i've played through on a rift s and the game displays models for the original rift controllers when starting the game up so some of the jankier mechanics aren't going to change anytime soon and there won't be any new features added anytime soon either.",1583796076,2,0,455179

"onward is a great game to have on your quest, especially if, like me, you¡¯re unable to play the pc version. however, there are many issues in this game, while not game breaking, they truly are immersion breaking. the graphics are those you would see in an fps game made by a guy named khaled harim on the google play store (not the app store). no offense is meant, but graphic wise, this game is terrible compared to basically every other game on the oculus store (for quest). i¡¯m not sure how improved they are on the quest 2, but i hope to find out soon. the gun models in this game are horrendous, and the controls for releasing the magazine for different weapons are a bit confusing. in the loadout selection, most of the guns blend in to the black background of the case they¡¯re in, so you can hardly see them. pulling the charging handle on an, slapping a bolt, pulling the slide; all of these actions are done with a weird hand motion where your hand doesn¡¯t even touch those things. there¡¯s other problems with graphics and weapons, but those aren¡¯t as bad. gunplay, other than reloading of course, is phenomenal. recoil is present no matter what. hold a gun with one hand, the recoil is more severe. hold it with two, recoil is still there but less severe. the gun sounds aren¡¯t too great, but using them and shooting them feel amazing. everything else besides graphics, i praise in this game. this game is 4 stars as of right now, but if you guys improve the graphics to match those of, say, gun club vr, and add more blood for realism, this game will be 5 stars.",1602818614,5, ,228488

"nice game. the best way to describe it ""half - life but made by indie developer"". you get transported into this giant research facility and try to escape as local guards (robots) and alien fauna and flora tries to kill you. has some spooky, cool boss fights. 

vr elements are taken seriously, you can interact with objects, aim down gun sights, climb ladders manually, use ziplines, kinda fun.

took me 5 hours to finish without rushing.

word of caution: you might need a good pair of vr feet. 
play with controlls rebinding - it's early game so it uses lecagy controlls, it uses grip to go forward - kinda strange on index controller, so i remapped joystick forward as grip. trigger grabs stuff, so i remapped grip to work as trigger alongside trigger, made it a more seamless experience.

and one other thing - game lacks polish a bit, bug there and there, you can get yourself trapped in a wall or fall through the floor sometimes. sometimes it autosaves in a bad time, but you can always restart level.

"i've been waiting for this game to come out since i saw it on steam, and i definitely recommend giving it a quick play. there are currently only 3 minigames, as follows:

- shoot drones flying at you and deflect their bullets with a light saber. not much else to say about this. 

- block soccer balls from getting into your goal using two giant hands (this gets pretty difficult pretty fast imo)

-  a holopoint-style bow game where you shoot robots before they get to you

all of them increase in difficulty over time and are pretty fun for a bit. 

the only problems i can see so far are that the resolution seems a little low, which i guess is fine especially if you're on a lower system, and the holopoint-esque game seems to have a bug where enemies can't hit you when you're looking at them.

oh, and the way you add arrows to your bow makes you want to clash your controllers together. 

updating this review and sacrificing the ratings it has because the game is now $10, rather than free. the developer is kind of pushing it at this price, and though it's a bit of fun i certainly wouldn't pay more than 5.",1469435832,3,0,503499
"quite a fun game, but i can recommend that you should be drunk before you start the game.
a vr game where you can simply play beer pong without any special rules against a robot or against a friend in multiplayer mode.
it seems more difficult in the game compared to real beer pong to get the ball into the cups or i just couldn't aim properly, i won't claim i was completely sober when i played the game,
anyway, when the ball that the opponent throws ends up in 1 of your cups you will have to drink this cup, and vica verca, depending on the amount of cups you take in you will also get a drunk-like effect over your view.

"i am blown away by how amazing and fun this game can be. everyone has a tracer-like warp dash that allows for quick movement anywhere in front of you, including above. it does have it's limits and cooldowns, so if you are a tracer main in overwatch, you'll get this down very fast. no recalling when in danger though.

the level designs are great with plenty of ways to flank and push the opposition. grind rails are a prominent map feature, allowing you to get around much quicker. currently, there is only a handful of maps, each with there own objective (payload, domination, control, deathmatch) and an option to play with random mutators to spice up the gameplay (low gravity, instakill guns, half damage and others.) you can also do this offline with bots if you so desire, which is great if you love these games, but are not a ""team player"" and just want to blow off some steam.

the weapons are a bit on the small side, with only 7 different guns, but each have a unique gameplay style to them. you always dual wield and you can mix and match as you find them. want an smg and a rocket launcher? it's there. wanna go double sniper? have at it. they all feel fairly well balanced.

*edit 4/1/21* my only real complaint of this game was this. i consider myself a now above average player, but nowhere near ""pro"" level. i just play this on a casual basis. but there were games where it's pretty even and have been loads of fun. but there are players who have been playing since the alpha and they easily jump in and one shot you with charged pistols constantly. luckily, they have made some strides to help correct this. they recently added an update to do private lobbies and level lock them if you didn't want to play with the ""sweaty"" players. and trust me, there are some sweaty players in this game. but now you have some control over this, which i greatly appreciate the developers making.

other than that, i really love this game a lot for what it is. i'm glad i picked it up and for it's affordable $20 (usd) price tag, you really can't go wrong. highly recommended fps.",1617333814,5, ,257653

the menus aren't always the most intuitive- but once you figure it out it is pretty great. don't use oculus, steam, or discord chat with it, you'll have a mild echo- there is game chat built into the game. start on easy mode- even easy mode is more of a medium or difficult  setting. i like that you win fights you have to change up your tactics, wait for the blocks and pick your moment to strike. its frustrating at times, but it makes the game challenging, rewarding and fun.

mainly played the holdout mode, disappointed at the lack of weaponry inside this mode. the kf i know and love has a ton of whack, badass weapons. not really worth full price but if you're reading this during the sale, it's not a bad idea to pick up for $10. holdout can get boring and is more of a challenge to see how long you want to run in a circle rather than how long can you go. difficulty seems to drop off at a certain point, after playing for 15 minutes i noticed difficulty stagnation and i lasted for about 25 more before i decided i got bored. holdout is a snoozefest of a mode and considering it's like, the other half of the game, i feel confident in basing my review off this. i'll probably touch upon the story mode later but i can't recommend it if you're seeking a solid vr experience like pavlov, onward, beat saber, etc. stuff you would constantly return to. i hope the devs build more on it though.",1533273374,3,1,686328

the game has some good ideas, but the ""not alice in wonderland"" alice in wonderland theme was tiring. the dialogue choices don't have any impact, the movement of the environment was clunky, the story goes nowhere and is not engaging, and the characters are dull. by the time i reached the end i thought i was only maybe 2/3 into the game, and that there was more coming, but there wasn't.

something that bothered me was that you can reach the end of the game without getting x nuread morember of invitations, thus forcing you into a ""bad"" ending where you can only choose the ""bad"" ending dialogue with the queen. it doesn't tell you how many you need to get for a good ending. then you're made to sit through the credits while the narrators basically berate you for not doing well enough.

the computer programmers have already solved most of visual issues many decades ago in just 30 years just waiting for the slow process of engineers who lack any imagination of computer programmers, visual artists and story tellers.  hence, we don't have rl ties to virtual world.   
engineers failed us by making heaver than phone headsets, no default wireless headsets, cheap as phone headsets, no decent controllers or better yet work without controllers, and many other issues they been trying to design androids for 100 years yet computer scientists already can simulate the real world in a small box in few decades.  but i digress engineers are boring as hell as people remind me of electricians with a little math.  engineers frontier science is there if you want to make billions.  in mean time as usual computer programmers making billions are leading the way, however you vr hardware engineers go back to designing coke cans or juice boxes, if you can't design a proper vr suit or vr headset maybe programmers have to do that too.",1565545724,2,4,699488

"[h1]experienced on the meta quest 2[/h1]

you can view my full live review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/8fblb0rhli8

i am a big vr rollercoaster fan. as a big vr coaster fan, i have experienced almost every vr coaster on the steam or oculus store platforms. vr coasters are usually very short & over-priced. so it's no wonder that very few vr coasters have been released in recent years.

scare train vr looks really good, better than most vr coaster experiences. it is 6 minutes long, seated, purely cinematic ""on-rails"" experience. there are no alternate routes. if you played it once, you can maybe play it again to see stuff that happens behind you. maybe notice some details you missed. 

however, there really isn't that much replayability. this is something you showcase to family & friends new to vr. this is a pretty slow vr ride. it's not really scary, but scary enough for kids & maybe kids at heart. there's lots of spiders though ... some wolves ... and some demons.

game is running on the unreal engine. on my rtx 3080, i was getting mostly 90 fps. however, i did notice some stutters along the way / frame rate drops. you only use motion controllers to select start or quit at the menu. there are no settings. you don't have an avatar body or even avatar hands. 

i have to admit, i was disappointed at the end of the ride. it's not a bad vr coaster ride. it's better than the average vr rollercoaster. but it's just not a very thrilling ride, especially for hardened vr veterans. 

[b]rate 6/10. recommended only for vr coaster fans.[/b]

"this was one of the first vr games that i bought so it'll always have a soft spot in my heart. i loved the concept of switching between 3rd and 1st person while defending against waves of enemies, and coupled with the graphics i had a tons of fun both playing this game and sharing it with others.

that being said, i would only recommend buying this game in its current state if you manage to find it on sale. it seems to have been more or less abandoned by both the devs and other players on multiplayer, creeping into a state of being outdated with nobody to play with. i can't imagine getting more than a few hours out of the game from singleplayer alone, which really doesn't justify a cost of $20.",1501103651,3,0,477134
"i've logged on twice now. first time i couldn't find a match. it takes like a full 5min to load on quest 1.

2nd time was the charm, found like 5-10 matches. unfortunately the experience was terrible. most games i died very quickly, before even hitting the ground one time. there isn't any real explanation of what to do, and all the games went like this:
1. launch into the map.
2. collect weapons, ammo, and shield.
3. you and all your teammates get shot from a mile away and the game ends.

it's like i didn't even get to play. my teammates didn't fair much better so i'm clearly not alone.

there needs to be some type of learning mechanism instead of throwing us to the sharks. i don't see how i can ever improve or get into this game. not sure why anyone would stick around.

answers to other reviewers - 

1.when i purchased more credits they didn't show until i tried to buy another property, maybe a bug

although boneworks can make you nausous and the physics can be weird sometimes, i love this game for one reason, the atmosphere. i get that my opinion is a bit weird but the game really gives off the vibe of ""you are not supposed to be here"", which is kinda what the story is about. the world the game creates feels unfinished in a good way, the way where you never know whats coming next and everything is unexpected. i've never seen any game that gives off that feeling as good as boneworks and that's why i love this game.",1591428101,0,0,717357

"first off all, this game is great. the maps are mostly balanced, the guns are decent, and the graphics are good. i have a blast playing this, but most fights go like this:

-i spawn near an enemy, who has full shields and a one shot rpg 
-i shoot down onto the team in zone, but they have full shields and shoot the top pixel of my hitbox
-i attack an enemy, and their teammates shoot me from behind
- 1v3s,3v1s, etc. happen way to often and teams are extremely unbalanced.


this game needs some serious balancing, it¡¯s nearly impossible to have a fight without their teammate finishing you for on behind, and (despite landing way more hits with the same weapon) they live because they spawned near shields and right behind you.

they should rework the shields, and try to encourage more actual battles. too many fights are won by sheer firepower rather than aim, and the shield system needs to be nerfed.

i love this game and have played it everyday, but i think three lvl 50s shouldn¡¯t be up against a single lvl 50 and a level 9.

"i feel sad for people without vr at this point, you got boneworks, vrchat, pavlov, and now a new half-life game,

it feels amazing, and good to play, some teleport functions through windows and so on is a bit lame after
playing boneworks for so long and the freedom it gives you, therefor hl alyx's movement feels way more
fleshed out and robust, no glitching out or anything.

sounds amazing, and looks amazing.

it just feels good having valve back, finally something that isn't old source, every animation and the models
look so goddamn good,

it's already worth it to get vr for the games i listed above, but hl alyx puts a nail in the coffin telling you to finally wake up, and smell the ash- i mean - and see that vr are a good investment.

"after hearing about the new 50 node limit, i am happy that it is worthwhile, and optimistic for what is too come of the app. i will probably buy the subscription if i can complete my project, because although the subscription itself hasn¡¯t changed, it is clear the devs are trying to help out the players and make the app easier to use. there is one people complaining that it is useless, and they are completely wrong! when i got in it was beautifully laid out, the idea of a 3d whiteboard! i thought the app of my dreams would be some massive 2d one but this! this is next level. no longer do i have to weave around my ideas into a mess, now we have actual sections that can be easily accessed! i have never been good at using words to loosely express my ideas, i have always remembered and learnt better visually. so yeah it is just a 3d whiteboard, and that is what makes it genius. i would recommend to try it, because the majority of people probably have a bigger budget then my 200$ to spend a year. i will definitely by this once i am old enough to get a job!



when i heard that this was coming out i was super excited. i have always had a hard time mapping out my thoughts. i got in, decided to see how the app works before paying. i was going through, and i built a really cool map! then i tried placing another node. i tried again. it turns out you don¡¯t get 100, not 50, but a nice 30 nodes. i couldn¡¯t even finish one map. so i decided to pay the amount. 6$ seems quite cheap. then in the corner of my i see the per month. i would¡¯ve been willing to spend 20$, thats around the price of a good oculus game. but 6$ a month? in just 4 months you would¡¯ve paid the amount for a full game. in a year you would¡¯ve paid for 3 games. i was ok with the other restricted features, but to lock the entire app behind a paywall? too far. my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.",1627183414,5, ,295694

i thought there would be more story and more interaction with the girl. but it is really just a few very short scenes without much content excpet to provide a reason to feel her up. the other content (nude patch required?) can be selected and is just various sexy scenes that you can directly select. so yes, i am disappointed.
also, even with the patch her girly bits below are censored in typical japanese pron mosaic.

support for wmr is pretty bad. some actions cannot be done with the controller, i found out that you can use mouse buttons/wheel for some.
floor height adjustment was not possible for me. it sort of is ok if i start seated as i found out.

on the positive side, the graphics and animation are well done, very realistic.

full review:

this is the first true vr ""game"". 
i can tell the developers know this because they flaunt it and taunt other games by having ""what if this is just a tech demo"" scribbled on the walls in a dark souls esq previous user fashion. 

as of writing this review i have played the game for about 12 and a half hours (with 30 mins of afk time) and i still have not finished the campaign. i believe i am near the end.
not only is the game lengthy like a single player game should be, but it is an absolute joy to play with a ton of replayability due to the infinite possibilites in some situations with the physics. 

some of the funnest things i have done in this game other than playing through it include:
1) grabbing a headcrab (i hate them and you will too!), and trying to shove it into a trash bin. when i realized it wouldn't fit, i took a sledgehammer, placed the crab on top of the bin and hammered it into the trash bin, then continued to hammer the bin itself so that thing never gets out again. 
2) doing pull-ups while hanging above a drop that would surely kill me.
3) skipping small pieces of the puzzle areas by climbing and using the full body physics system
4) getting jumpscared by head crabs so hard my gun literally disapeared as far as i could tell
00) i can't list all of the fun things you can do with the physics. play the game with an imagination and you will do something noone else has.

the gunplay is amazing and so is the melee combat. the graphics are okay, however; they are carried by the fantastic world scaling, clarity, art work, and smooth vr motion. when you are in the vr world the graphics themselves actually come in 2nd to these factors when it comes to visuals. 

cons- save points are sometimes a full hour apart, it doesn't have multiplayer, various small bugs sprinkled around. that's literally it. 

anyway, if you own a vr headset you have to buy it, you have no choice in the matter :p",1577691885,3,0,720965

"this game is just awesome! it works with so many different genres of music (i've tried classical, rock, jazz, film scores, disney...) and the only one that didn't work quite so well was techno, as the algorithm struggles a bit with the music's ""stuttery"" nature, messing up its reading of the tempo. while playing it with some songs, it really helps you appreciate the different layers to the music, often that i didn't even realise were there. and when pieces slow down or speed up, its really easy to feel it happening with the action. 10/10 the best one i played on it would be hall of the mountain king by edvard greig. its build up feels legendary!

tl;dr more than worth your money .",1480619797,3,0,448390
"played 1 song on demo and then got the game :)

i like these types of game, i really liked audiosheild but that is starting to feel abit to stale after 20+ hours and wanted something different. this game does it perfectly, the swapping instruments are a great touch so each song feels like a new game. considering this is early access, the current content feels extremely well polished and the only thing i can critisize is the ammount of songs to choose from (in comparison to the fact you can use any song for things like audiosheild). 

but this is early access and one of the best early access released i have played in a while, i have only recently purchased it but looking at the patch notes new content is added often enough and i am sure either a build your own song addition/mod or automatic generator will be added at some point which will truly unlock the potential of this.

even now looking at it, there is enough content to keep you going, but extras could be added in such as additional skins for the dancers and/or instruments (maybe earn currency via doing well on tracks) or even some sort of multipalyer (hotseat score keeping). just some ideas though, i am sure some excellent stuff is going to come out of this.

pro's
extremely well polished
great visuals
very fun
great music 
cheap!

con's
if you played it to death i suppose the same 28ish songs might get boring.

if you are still unsure, just try the demo :) but this is on my must have list for vr.

"[h1]used on: [b]htc vive[/b][/h1]

first and foremost, vive video works on both the htc vive and the oculus rift. it also does not have the capability of youtube, netflix, or any other content that is not directly downloaded to your computer. there is no web browser, either. it's free, and as far as free software goes it gets the job done. you're able to watch videos in a flat format, side-by-side, or over-under in either 180¡ã or 360¡ã.

the interface is a little confusing and hard to get used to at first, but once you take the time to play around with the settings it's not so bad. you can also turn the ""lights off"" to watch your content without any borders, and you can play around with the movie screen size (if you're watching in flat-view, of course) to where it's either super small, or it takes up your entire field of vision.

at its core, vive video is a fine, free movie viewing software. it's extremely basic, but it gets the job done. of course, paid software such as ovrdrop bring in a variety of new options, including the ability to watch youtube, netflix, and interact with your favorite desktop applications inside vr. however, content like that comes with pricetags around the spectrum of $16.99 cad. if you save most of your content to your ssd/hdd/ehdd, then vive video will suit you just fine.

one thing to note that i found particularly impressive was the ""directional"" voice chat and the ability to reach up to the shoulder for radio, the sound effect of that is awesome and playing with people with actual body language and teamwork took multiplayer to a whole new level previously untouched by conventional games.

"this is a big warning do not buy this game until your a big 40k fan (trust me it¡¯s way better if you know the lore and are at lest some what invested in the table top. big ask ik but trust me this is the ideal way of playing it. also a quest 2 it¡¯s not a must but it¡¯s definitely better) this game legitimately made me giggle like when i was 7 and watching spider-man 2 there are just fantastic moments that made me so happy. the gun play is solid. the guns look and sound amazing. the environments are beautiful and diverse. the boss fights while not challenging look fantastic. the powers could use some work but other than that it¡¯s a great game. if you still aren¡¯t convince and don¡¯t care about spoilers keep reading (spoilers) ¡­ holding a bolter in vr was surreal, picking up a lasgun and hearing a npc make a joke about how useless it is made me chuckle. seeing a primaris space marine up-close made me giggle like a child. fighting a terminator marine  was nerve racking, fighting a chaos titan was insane and fighting along side an imperial titan was even more awesome. you know those cool looking chaos brass scorpions? you fight them! this games isn¡¯t a masterpiece. it¡¯s not the half life alyx of 40k, but my god is it amazing.",1668265320,5,"Thank you for the positive review!!

"vr is in desperate need of good melee brawlers, and i think there's a lot of good ideas on display in frenzy. grabbing a guy, chucking him through furniture, and watching it smash apart is very satisfying, and i encourage the developer to continue with that fun, physics-based mayhem. 

still, the game itself needs a lot of work; it's very janky, and falls far too close to that tech demo-y feel a lot of vr games have. enemies barely react to melee strikes and it's basically impossible to interrupt their attacks, so melee combat feels like a slog. not helping this is that weapons don't have a unique feel to them; they seem to all handle the same, whether they be a wooden baseball bat or a sledgehammer, and the speed and arc of your swing doesn't seem to effect damage or knockback at all. 

more levels is good, but i think the developer's focus at the moment should be on nailing the melee combat, because that's what's really gonna put this game on people's radars. this is a hesitant recommendation, but i'm hopeful they can make improvements and make this into one of vr's truly great beat-em-ups.",1659292372,0,,119838019

there aren't any progression at the moment. only different locations where you can choose some gamemodes with minor differences on the spawn system and difficulty of the enemies.

part of what makes this experience very poignant, is the voice recordings used.  you can tell that this is not acting.  you can hear the fear, plus all the other emotions in their voices.  the dialogue is raw and real.  it's also amazing to think that these sisters (of the deceased) put their own lives at risk to try to defuse the situation.

ok albeit short vr escape room ... this one is a borderline no because a) the game is not only short but artificially lengthened by the slowness of the elevator and b) as a previous reviewer has mentioned the twisting of the elevator as you go up and down is nauseating. the idea is sound (increase room size without the need for locomotion) but i feel would have been better served by a cage that went straight up and down and just opened to the room you stopped on.,1538973835,2,0,595251

i have committed 290 hours worth of atrocities in this game. the modding content has made this the greatest vr game possibly of all time. a sequel improving the slight bugs would possibly shatter the gaming community.,1678296916,0,,134306914
"really hard to put a score to this game, because it's honestly not game, its a relatively short single player experience, and an entire vr game toolkit. i think the potential is huge, and we're already seeing a lot more mods come out, once full multiplayer becomes a reality this will be like nothing else. i want to like it as much as i liked boneworks, and i think eventually i will, but it just needs time for the community to establish.

the game plays great, you have to expect a bit of jank in the combat and physics at times, but its always minor and its never been smoother since boneworks. they've streamlined alot of features like the collectables, you no longer have to choose between a weapon and a collectable is a good choice. what wasn't a good choice is not telling you this, i spent 20 minutes trying to lug these orbs around annoyed that i couldn't store them in my inventory. the only hint you get are two faint arrows while holding a collectable to tell you to ""pop it open"", once you do, its automatically saved, and there's no reclamation bin to visit. 

and to be honest, that's kinda how the rest of the story mode goes. yes i like that it doesn't hold your hand, but some aspects of it can be extremely vague like the lab main menu crane puzzle to advance past the prologue. i think this game could have benefited from another museum level, which was one of my favorites in the original, it had such a sense of wonder, charm, and had an amazing atmosphere that carried though out the entire game. bonelab on the other hand doesn't capture this same magic for me, its like its lacking something but i could never figure it out, its not the soundtrack was bad either, but it didn't have the same impact-fullness to it. boneworks just nailed everything, it really ruined most other vr games for me, which was hard because it was one of my first vr games.

and to sum it up, i just find it while amazing in a lot of aspects, just didn't quite live up to the first game, i'm gong to keep playing it, doing a second play through collecting everything, and i am enjoying the heck out of it. but i think the story isn't as impressive, i enjoyed a lot of parts, but i think the puzzles were much easier, the combat less intense, the atmosphere a bit less immersive, the narrative a bit less interesting, and the ending vary unsatisfying. 

i still highly recommend this game, and if you loved boneworks you will love this as well, and if you didn't, this won't change it for you.",1665471872,0,,123670003

graphics and storyline is pretty sweet, but you need to avoid moving around. this is not a roam / standing vr game as such, doing so can move you outside of the playing area and just end up with a black screen. perhaps best to sit or stand (if you are a kid or short enough) in one spot to look around. the idea of moving in this game it from mind control, jumping from one persons point of view to another.you also don't have hands as such, rather look to what you want to control and click the controller button. this might appear restricting the game at first, but jumping into various creatures such as a whale or a flea, gives an interesting look to the vr game.",1524425754,2,2,704210

"i had very high doubts at first with this game, not the game itself,but that it requires uplay account to even launch, if uplay goes down, this game will too. as i found out the hard way for 5 or so days being locked out of the game until uplay updated.

when it worked however, you can expect a whole new experiance! when you launch the game you are thrown headfirst into the star trek universe! 

pros:
-immersive, very detailed interiors and themes!
-star trek style adventures! 
-quite alot of replayabilty
-exellent atmophere!
-challenging at times!

cons:
-very 2 dimentional interface, perticularly in captain role where you click buttons to complete scenarios. it doesn't feel polished.
-no official star trek music (that was a killer :( )
-ultra dumb ai, it is very common for them to take shortcuts into obsticals as though they arn't there.
-avatar customisation is somewhat non- existant (verly limited range of features) 

these being said, if you are a fan of star trek, you will love this game regardless! it sets the atmosphere perfectly! if you are not a fan, i'd recommend a look but it may not be as enticing.

so uplay and the few cons aside, i still will give this 5 stars for bringing star trek that bit closer to reality!",1544066614,5, ,312561

"you've heard of games accused of being tech demos... well, budget cuts has the inverse problem of being a tech demo accused of being a game. this is a collection early vr brainstorming ideas that don't mesh well together and yet it was somehow heavily promoted. the store page makes it look like a stealth action game, but most of your time is wasted getting lost or trying to figure out what exactly you're supposed to do. the level design is atrocious and completely illogical, including rooms with no physical doorways, vents that lead nowhere, and unintuitive level layout that requires frequent backtracking. this is yet another so-called game in the vr essentials bundle that feels like it lucked into its success just by getting into the market early.

as usual for early vr games, the combat has a lot of issues. enemies will one shot you with their guns or their melee, but you have to land headshots with pointed implements (throwing knives, scissors, darts, etc.) in order to kill them. you can only hold six items at a time, including key items, so you're usually only carrying 2-4 ""ammo"" at once since they all break after use. the throwing mechanic boosts your physical swing a bit, but there's zero aim assist or homing to it; you're better off just teleporting on top of an enemy and stabbing them in the face since ammo is so sparse. in total i think i only killed maybe 10 enemies through the whole game and even that was a bit excessive from getting lost. 

once you finally get used to the combat, the game springs a terrifying nemesis-style last boss on you. the last level is again frustrating like the one in alyx for similar reasons; you technically can get past him with some trickery, fast reaction times, and some luck with your portal gun bounces, but most players will need to trick him into a closet to lock him inside. even after doing that, i had to look up a youtube playthrough to figure out where to go after that because the room after his is just a dead end. some people might want to skip this game entirely just because of this sequence; the horror and psychological horror tags on the store page are not a joke and shouldn't be taken lightly. 

the game has a pleasantly clean aesthetic, but that's because they used a lot of untextured solid colors so that it could run on a geforce 970 (a potato gpu, even for 2018). roomscale tracking works great, letting you dodge melee and ranged attacks from enemies, physically peek around corners, and walk around to interact with the environment. the only other positive thing about this game is how short it is: this'll take you about three hours to finish, depending on how lost you get. the vr tax is heavy here, so basic praises like ""the controls work and the graphics are okay"" are high praise for such an expensive experience.

if for some reason you do want to play this, just buy budget cuts ultimate instead, which includes both games plus bonus content. for some reason budget cuts 1, 2, and ultimate all still cost $30 and there's oddly a bundle for all three of them. the best thing to come out of this game was the content it made for streamers, most notably the infamous giant bomb stream. some older vr games are interesting as a novel glimpse into the past, watching devs throwing everything they could think of against the wall in hopes of something sticking. this however is a frustrating mess and isn't worth playing.",1723413597,0,,171925656

"first impressions are good. playing on a valve index with a 2080ti. just going to list off some things.

-graphics are excellent, finally a game designed for pcvr and not quest!

-audio design is pretty good, i like the music and atmosphere but some sounds are lacking with physics objects/interactions.

-performance, pretty smooth 90fps with 150% ss

-climbing, theres still jank but considering its a full physics avatar, the climbing feels a lot smoother here compared to something like boneworks or bonelab.

-jank in general. a lot of interactions are kinda janky. just be aware of this going in. not a deal breaker for me though. i've experienced far worse.

-smooth turning option with plenty of speed adjustment, these devs know whats up

-index support is fine, theres no finger tracking or even oculus-style gestures (theres only open hand or grab), but all the controls work perfectly fine. able to be rebind via steam input mappings if needed.

-voice acting/characters are good. the character models are pretty good but the citizen npc's are pretty goofy. 

-the 2 handed gun play isn't that good, the offhand grip is way off and makes the rifle unconformable to hold with both hands. however the pistol feels fine and the bullets have travel so dodging them can be fun. devs were smart to have the pistol reload on the side so you don't have to bash the controllers together. the melee enemy ai isn't that great but the enemies with guns are fine. 

-no issues with hand alignment (besides 2 handed guns). the hands aren't as perfectly aligned as hl:a but its good enough. 

i'm almost 2 hours in and i'm just about to ""upgrade my gloves"". so the game seems to be a decent length if you like exploring a bit for credits and messing around. there are also other modes like arena and parkour, but i'm only interested in the campaign. so far so good though! story is actually interesting too.

"what i write for this review is the experience i had with the game, everybody will experience things differently. this is my honest review if you don't like it well tough. also no game is safe from a review whether its early access or full release, now onto the review.

zombie busters vr is an anime stand still shooter game. you only have to turn to look in different directions to eliminate zombies for a score playing until the game is beat or you die in the end totaling your score. this game has no relation to the other zombie buster vr game even though they are almost similar just one is anime style. 

the game-play is what you expect from a stand in one place type of game. you have no moving option which isn't a bad thing as long the game is good for the style.

sounds in the game is okay nothing out of the ordinary except that there is no audio option to turn the game down, you have to turn it down on the computer so you don't blow your ear drums out.

there is only one weapon in the game & all the characters use the same weapon. the only thing to make them powerful are shoot-able power ups to give you a few shots to eliminate zombies faster & easier but no way to store the pick ups for later. the only issue i have with the weapons is they are not proper height so shooting is awkward.

the characters are okay without english audio or subtitle its hard to understand what each character is saying.

the bosses are unique & have their own powers making them different but in the end there is nothing to really do to specifically beat them. just shoot until they die avoiding or prevent their ability from damaging you. the only boss i have trouble with is the giant boss. not sure how to defeat him before dying. 

there is no co-op which is disappointing since that is on feature that got me to buy the game in the first place.

zombie busters vr is a good game & with more updates, fixes & more features it can be a fun game but with the audio, no co-op & weapon issues i listed its not really worth playing to be honest. the game gets a 4/10 score making it under average & making it not recommendable.",1582939014,3,0,389833
"got an occulus as a gift from work this was the first game i downloaded and honestly it has definitely darkened my perception of vr. there was nothing in the way of a tutorial everything was trial and error. half of the time the weapons didn't do what i wanted. i'd go to block a swing with my sword only for the enemies weapon to just pass right through it. finding and keeping an even flow and speed with the weapons was also a hassle. to slow and all of your attacks become easy to dodge, to fast and the vr has issue registering it. then there's the magic the only one that worked for me was the lighting spell and that's only cause it auto targets things for you.. fireball was a joke you could be point blank and still miss as it literally seemed to go which ever direction it wanted. i can't even tell you what the third spell was supposed to be or do as i couldn't get it to work. using your melee stomp attack was also a hassle. i could be standing right above them looking at the head and my characters stomp attack just went off at random angles. i felt like i doing the river dance but messing it up royally. overall not worth the money or time i put into to. save yourself a headache and don't buy.",1671132060,5, ,105570

"first off, let me say that in buying this game i was already expecting the original bugs plus some new ones. but wow they messed this one up bad. 

  here's a list of bugs i experienced in my first hour of playtime: 

blurred lines and dots would form on my fov and stay there. they would flicker in and out with the change of lighting.

menus would disappear. you can hear the sounds of scrolling through them, but nothing would appear. 

dialog menus would not appear at all. 

my weapons would just put themselves away mid combat. 

i ended up punching ralof in the opening cutscene by just moving my hand, which made me have to restart the game a few times.

"excellent game, so far!
i say 'so far' because it does feel incomplete at times. 
the opening sequence seems a bit rough; the english translation is not the best one; and it so needs and option to turn the camera around.

i play in a very small space, and even though i am able to turn around in real life with relative comfort it would be so much better to be able to just reposition the center manually whenever i wanted. this is the only thing that this game really needs. 
even as it is the gameplay is almost flawless, but getting tangled with the cables of the vive as i fight against 4 giant lizards is not the coolest thing ever...

this game feels like 'deadly hunter 2' (if you haven't played 'deadly hunter', you should. it's really fun, and it's free!) in a way. i'm not a fan of deserts and i'd love to have a different setting with more 'cool' colors; but that's just me. the game is fun, immersive and it looks great.

i'm pretty sure they will be polishing it a bit more, so hopefully it will only get better... i can't wait for that. this developer seems to have a pretty good grasp on what makes a vr action game fun.

since it's a free game, the download is a no-brainer if you like action and fantasy games.
it's an awesome experience in vr.",1501660237,0,0,682700

"it's probably one of, if not the best vrfps to get anyone started?

community is great, the game is great and the interaction is fantastic. i hope onwards continues wit h huge updates and new maps. 

yes, it will take you a while to get over the ""motion sickness"" if you're looking game for a long time. even at that, the games are tuned quite well!

as far as graphics go, they're brilliant for vr, obviously work can be done and improved here and there but vr is nowhere near its peak, it's just starting to take off if you ask me especially with the release of the quest 2!

coms are great, normally everyone is quite active and it gives a real immersion and feel. 

glitches: main one is just the loading screens and lobby, i don't know if these can be helped at all but it does mess with your eyes a bit in the headset! 

gunplay is spot on, takes a while to adjust on how to actually aim with sights etc but once you are there you'll start getting some kills and it's so satisfying! 

4* from me, it isn't perfect, but i hope updates come.",1604892214,5, ,228487
"mission iss gives great weight to the old adage ""the best things in life are free.""   this is a spectacular app!

it provides a full and detailed recreation of the iss' interior, and the views of space and earth through exterior facing windows are truly breathtaking.

add to that the ability to control the canadarm to help a supply capsule dock, and a spacewalk, and by the end of this, you'll feel you've been there, and done it.

the only criticism, the experience is all to brief - as is too often the case with vr exclusive titles.  still, this is a must-have for anyone and everyone, particularly if you're a stargazer.

an incredible game could be made out of this layout.  life on the iss.  a few weeks of missions, experiments, canadarm tasks, spacewalks and repairs ... it's screaming for an update.  ah well, it costs nothing to dream. :)

"this was the first game i actually paid for. although i'm decent at escape rooms, i never would have finished it if i hadn't had the hints turned on (which i didn't do intentionally -- maybe it's the default?). solving the puzzle is mostly a series of variations on the same basic idea, so some experienced puzzlers might find it too simple. and i found the manipulation of objects a bit clunky and frustrating at times. but overall it seems like an excellent intro into this genre of vr games.",1609644214,5, ,165691
"so far, most of the negative reviews i've read on steam about this game boil down to the reviewer not understanding the limitations of vr. for instance, they think a vr game is going to have the same crisp resolution as a 1080p or 4k flatscreen monitor. eventually, headsets will achieve this. the industry concensus is that headsets will need to support about 8k [i]per eye[/i] (so 16k combined) before vr environments feel about as crisp as flat-screen environments. this isn't hard to understand if you think about it for a moment: in vr your eyes are much closer to the display, so the apparent resolution is lower.

if you understand these sorts of limitations in the current state of the art, and you love fallout, you will [i]probably[/i] love this game. the new medium [i]will[/i] require you to adjust your playing style. those adjustments are mostly a good thing, because it makes the experience much more immersive than the flat version. for instance, i find myself using the correct posture, as far as is possible, for each weapon. so, for instance, i support my right hand with my left for handguns. i try to hold assault rifles the way you would actually hold one; of course, there's nothing there, so in order to feel correct, i have to hold my hands and controllers together in this position. i hold a minigun at my waist. of course, you don't have to do this. they effectively have no weight, so if you want to wave a minigun around like a toothpick and shoot people gangsta style, you can. however, the amazing thing is that when you treat them like the real-world analogs, they [i]behave better in the game[/i], i.e. they operate and feel more like a real-world version. for all of the postures above, you find the corresponding weapons easier to aim properly and hit your target efficiently.

you will also find yourself using cover more effectively, and clearing rooms using squad tactics if you are familiar with them. it's pretty great. all of the environmental elements that seemed somewhat flat to me on a screen now ""pop"" more - they feel substantive and beefy, and you can inspect them very closely. one of the most enjoyable things to do in the game is just sit on the floor and examine a weapon in your hand - the shaders, the textures, the model. it's much more satisfying than inspecting an item in the flat version. also, when you are talking to people, you really feel like you are talking to them, because you are [i]in[/i] the environment with them. it's like you're in the world of tron and you got sucked into your computer to play games with the programs inside it. it feels amazing. i didn't experience the scale issues everyone mentions; i think that might be caused by their floor not being registered correctly. they probably just need to re-calibrate their room. in my game, everyone is scaled properly. dogmeat feels a little large, but actually that's about how big an adult male german shepherd gets; they're fairly tall dogs.

things also feel more visceral. early in the game i picked up a sawed-off, and minutes later a couple of raiders came around a door and as i dropped them at point blank range with one shot each, they exploded in gore right in front of me. i literally laughed out loud in glee; it was 10x more satisfying than the same thing on a screen. when you are sneaking up on people, it actually feels like you are sneaking up on them. you can crouch with your controller, but i prefer to do it manually, as it feels much more realistic. melee is also much more effective because you are actually doing it by swinging your hands rather than button mashing. when you aim a weapon, you actually aim it using the sights like a real weapon. i haven't had a chance to play with it much yet, but i loved the settlement crafting in the flat version, and the few minutes i tried out the settlement crafting in sanctuary felt very compelling.

there are flaws, of course. most of these have to do with the fact that this game simply wasn't designed for the medium. for an after-the-fact port, however, bethesda did an amazing job. i'm not sure how much better they could have done within budget and time constraints without going back to the drawing board. you can jump, which is great; i hope future games preserve that ability. but it does feel a bit jarring. your mileage will vary with other controls; some of the things i like others might not and visa versa, so i won't go into a blow-by-blow critique of every control. i do wish they had an in-game key describing the controller layout. it's sometimes difficult to discover what the control is for a particular behavior. there is a learning curve, but once your brain re-maps from a standard console controller to vr, those sorts of issues mostly melt away.

the biggest flaw of course, was that, as some of the negative reviews have correctly pointed out, sniping or other long-distance firearm tactics were difficult or impossible. as of the end of january 2018, this issue has now been solved with beta update 1.1.24.0:

https://bethesda.net/community/topic/187237/fallout-4-vr-steam-beta-update-1-1-24-0

one thing you will want to stay aware of is sim-sickness. the environment and content is so much more compelling than most other vr games that you will want to stay in for hours at a time. if you are not already accustomed to this, don't do it. it takes months to build up that kind of resistance to sim-sickness, especially if, like me, you prefer to use the touchpad for free movement instead of teleporting. if you push it too hard, you risk [i]lowering[/i] your tolerance to the point that you can't do vr at all anymore; eventually, you'll get sick immediately. what you need to do is stay conscious of whether you feel nauseous; if it surpasses a certain threshhold, which you will have to determine for yourself, stop playing immediately and wait a day. eventually, you will be able tolerate longer and longer play times. after about 150 hours in, i can now say that i have no issues with sim-sickness in this game.

additional update 02/16/18: it seems some of the issues with things in the sky like stars appearing to be at the wrong depth was due to only rendering in one eye. those and many other fixes are in the latest beta patch:

https://bethesda.net/community/topic/187237/fallout-4-vr-steam-beta-update-1-1-31-0-updated

update 02/07/18: there is a humble bundle vr sale on for the next couple of days.

buy this game if:

[*] like me, you played  700 hours in the flat version; you played new vegas and fallout 3 for hundreds of hours as well; you've even played fallout 2 or fallout and that new casual fallout shelter game, as well as the wasteland games by the original fallout team. you love fallout.
[*] you are very familiar with the technical limitations of vr, having played vr titles on multiple platforms like psvr, google daydream and vive.
[*] you don't mind sacrificing some things from the flat version and learning a completely new way to play the game, because you intuitively sense the inherent [b][i]awesome badassitude[/i][/b] of being [i]inside[/i] the world of fallout and you are willing to make that trade.
[*] you don't mind paying full-price for a port of a game you probably already paid full-price for, which was admittedly kind of a jerk move by bethesda - really, i put in 700 hours to the flat version and i don't get a discount? but again, you're okay with that even though it isn't your favorite way (see the above points).


don't buy this game if:

[*] you're not [i]that[/i] into fallout. you'd rather play cod with your friends.
[*] you aren't familiar with the limitations of vr and will fly into a spittle-spraying rage when, e.g., you learn that the vr version feels lower-res.
[*] you don't care about being inside a 3d environment, let alone the world of fallout.
[*] you cannot get over the sticker shock.

i would say its more of a partial arts type game as you cant do everything you can do in real life, but you can just about do most of it. bones cant be broken, there arent really ""non lethal"" take downs, and trying to smash someones face in by grabbing them by the head and nape is pretty exausting as it seems to do a fairly sad amount of damage currently. there are plenty of mods, with a bit of everything, star wars, legend of zelda, wh40k, lotr and even working guns. 

most of the world is very interactible, you can climb just about anywhere provided theres some form of edge or even a sharp enough corner, you can grab just about anywhere an on an enemy and basically flail them around as if they weighed nothing, you can even yeet shields so hard that the force can kill multiple enemies, theres currently one spell, electricity, how ever you can slow down time which can cause even a light tap to suddenly have 88x the force. 

if your quick enough, or, brave enough, you can actually grab an enemies weapon and beat them to death with it, provided its not a sword, tho you can still take it from them. you can absolutely punch and kick your way through a horde of enemies which i personally enjoy as most vr games dont seem to register that kind of attack.

how ever, i find the ""lag"" they added to weapons to make it feel like they have weight has made it so that attacks arent registered properly and even the best swing can get turned into little more than a light push and dead on thrusts will tend to rubber band an enemy. currently, its just wave sand box, which is actually done in quite a nice way, you control when waves appear and what difficulty the wave is at, and there seems to be a system in place for a full l4d/vermintide style of game mode along side a few combat driven story missions via mods.
 
all in all i give this a 7.5/10 

its worth a buy in its current state and i could play this forever as it is.",1574699673,3,0,666284

"boneworks is by far, my favourite vr game. it's not perfect but no game is. the game starts out a little boring, but eventually the game picks up its pace and it becomes alot of fun. combat is solid, best vr guns. melee combat with big long weapons for 
me was a little off sometimes. i've heard complaints about save points, for me this wasnt a problem as i played the game level by level instead of just randomly stopping in the middle of the level. the storys good but not why i would buy the game. everything in this game you can touch, if you can pick it up in real life you can pick it up in game. the only problems i had with the game are minor performance issues (my specs: gtx 1660ti, i7 9700, 16gb of ram). some things like crate debris covering another crate so you couldnt break the crate below it were annoying sometimes but didnt break the game or ruin the experience. this game is alot of fun and i've only played the story, i would highly reccomend this game to anyone with vr :)",1576565625,3,0,722231

"i don't know how what the bad reviews are talking about. this game is absolutely a gem when it comes to sport simulations. it nailed the mechanics perfectly. there are plenty of tricks, they are explained amazingly well using visual tutorials.

gameplay and first impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov1pfxivnsg

there is plenty of content in terms of the three maps that you can play, practice or just ride for fun. this game requires lots of practicing to remember the moves, and time it right. but practice makes perfect and progressing in this game rewards you with very satisfying gameplay experience when you are able to pull up some cool moves.

i was skateboarding many years ago and i loved it. this is the thing that got me as close as possible to real-life skateboarding. it takes a talented developer to make something like that and designed it well for vr.

i'm sure more updated will come and the game already shaping up to be a unique vr experience on steam that you ahve to try out if you love what you see in the videos. trust me, it's way better than in the videos in this case and one really have to experience to get the fill of it.

i'm sure you'll just enjoy riding the skateboard even without doing tricks, but the tricks is where the most fun begins. once you get it, give it time, try a few moves, then move to the others and enjoy the ones you have mastered so far.

highly recommended! - visuals look great on ultra btw",1633625069,0,0,393342

just because this is a bethesda title, do not think you can mod it as easily as the previous titles of the same name/series. i've tried multiple times to mod it and it doesn't show all mods that have been ""installed"".

without mods you cannot: pick items up with your hands, throw them, throw your weapons, draw your bow efficiently (as there is a giant amount of auto aim with bow actions), scale the room properly to irl conditions.

the game is overall very good. combat feels good and it's challenging. with some more optimization and twerking it can be even better. the issue i've encountered is that some time the character starts to move backwards on its own in weird/buggy way. i've tested other games to make sure it's not the controller. it happens randomly and then it stops on its own. overall the game has lots of potential.,1582860214,5,Thanks for the great feedback.

in the menu, you select with the a button instead of the trigger like you normally do, witch is not a problem, but irritating, hope they fix that.

yes you do get some squeakers once in a while but than you change lobby. have joined a lot of great lobbies.

also love the ability to download custom maps

two cons: 
-the movement of the players looks absolutely ridiculous. contractors gets that right, onward does not. deduct one star for that

-bought the game on quest expecting to be able to play on my pc.. apparently it's not possible and you have to buy it again. that's just stupid. if your on a budget and you love playing on pc and quest 2 stand alone then do not buy onwards, get contractors instead. money grabbing move. in my opinion this alone should reduce my review by two starts. 

but i feel 3 stars is about right!

would i recommend buying it. if you only have a quest 2 then yes but it absolutely it's a great game. if you own a pc and a quest, don't bother get contractors, best value overall.

first problem, no clear direction or instruction into the game or anything, it just throws you out into the game, no menu or options or control changing on any kind. you walk with right hand stick and snap with left. no option to change hands or smooth motion (oculus) the graphics are very weird, the crops and animals don't look great, but that's normal for vr, but the other farmers or whatever you call them are very very chibi. 

the worst thing about this game to me is when in came to the actual farming, i thought lets see how the crops work, i purchased some corn and it immediately became planted, fully grown and able to be harvested. i was expecting a small vr stardew or harvest moon, but what i played was a rushed mess that belongs in early accesses. i would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state, even for $3.50

i am a huge wimp and i don't usually do horror games. there were times where i'd stand at the start of a long, dark, scary hallway for several minutes and seriously question my life choices that brought me to that point. it was worth it though. it never felt old or repetitive, which was nice. each new area brought some new mechanics. for example, having to physically hold your hand over your mouth to avoid coughing in parts was wild.

"this game is just so awesome. i played 1 mission and immediately loved it. it¡¯s definitely a 5 star for me, it might have bad graphics on some things like a van or a dresser, but you don¡¯t even notice it. it makes you feel like your in a zombie apocalypse. you will get scared, not much though from what i¡¯ve seen. important, the game is coming out with a trial at some moment and you can play that and see if it¡¯s for you. i strongly suggest before playing to look at the settings and fix whatever you want in 
there like nausea comfort and grip and whatnot. it gives you a very helpful tutorial and there are 3 saves right now. i¡¯m not trying to spoil it too much, i¡¯m just explaining what it has and what you¡¯ll like or not like. the zombie jaw physics are pretty sick, the physics overall are literally like the pc version. only difference is graphics and more smoothness. i wish you best of luck and survival.",1602645814,5, ,245051

"super unstable. horrid optimisation. the developers have given up on this game. i came into this game expecting an experience similar to the first game. and it fell flat on its face. there are almost no new areas, i was willing to wait and see if the developers would fix the glaring issues with the game, and ho-boy there are a lot of issues, frequent crashes, lost saves, bad ai, boring npc's and bugs on top of bugs. 

all of that would have been fine if the game got fixed, however since the launch of the game it has had two updates. the last update took place over a year ago. 

i came back to the game recently to see the state that the game was in, only to find disappointment.
so much potential for an amazing sequel.

no scripting yet but they are working on a node based state mashine called udon that offers more freedom compared to the current trigger based system they use(at least i hope so).

"this is a fairly decent app, but the cartoonish graphics make it fun for a couple plays and then it¡¯s boring. i get more flying sensation from a youtube roller coaster video. it didn¡¯t give me that incredible vr feeling i got simply from putting on the go...  absolutely, positively not worth $7.99, and is of the caliber of games usually included with platforms. if you¡¯re reading this and it¡¯s $.99, sure, buy it now.",1582514614,5, ,31240

"overall a very positive experience... if my shoulder wasn't hurting from trying to climb too quickly, i'd be playing this non-stop. 

a word for the wise:  don't wholeheartedly believe the naysayers regarding the sub-par graphics. 
although, a lot of what they say has some truth due to the developer supporting every vr platform (namely quest and quest 2).  the sub-par graphics are compensated with above-par vr functionality and seemless cross-platform multiplayer.   the flying, climbing, reloading, and gunplay mechanics are made up of intuitive and forgiving vr mechanics.  all of this all while i'm playing on steam with friends on their quest, this game has crossed a lot of checkboxes for me that i didn't know existed.

i am very happy to support this game because if this is where it starts - already leagues above the rest - then in this game i see great potential.  but, that's not the last line of this review. it's not wise to fall in love with potential. because of that, i believe it to be worth mentioning that there is already plenty here to fall in love with.

"before i talk about owning this on the psvr before repurchasing on the quest/riff i¡¯m gonna explain something.

there¡¯s a very simple method is not only for easy mobility but it will also increase your fighting capabilities in pvp. first turn advance locomotion off!!! its unnecessary. now the game explains to swing your arms but there¡¯s an easier way, if you hold both of the move buttons down with the gloves to your face soon as you move your hands or sway, your whole body will follow. if you hold the buttons down and kinda may a skii motion forward or backwards you will shoot in that direction depending on how hard you swing. if you toy around with this you will learn even more advance tricks, like shooting directly behind your opponent, press the b button and automatically face them, most people can¡¯t react fast enough or don¡¯t know how to automatically face their opponent, so you can get some great shots in. works very well in singleplayer making you feel like dbz seeing them in slow motion while you¡¯re just planning which angle you should launch your next attack. 

now of course the stamina thing can be an issue but you won¡¯t ever fall into that situation if you just pick your shots, also i think they included this mechanics because certain fighter have stat buffs in certain punches, so to spam shots could be kinda cheating, would be nice if they had a mode where all the boxers are at an even level.

with that being said i am looking forward to survios next project, these fighting mechanics is what i wanted from a boxer. i played thrill of the fight but i think vrfighting champions has better mechanics than that game but creed has much better mechanics than both previous mentioned games imo. 5/5",1583983414,5, ,340403

"update after one week

long story short: buy it! this must be the best 20 i've ever spent. nothing comes even close to the amount of movement and cardio training. this is the one to get. noother rhythm game can touch this!

---

i play beatsaber and synthriders regularly to keep me fit - but i was looking for something new in the fitness/dance/body movement direction. 

having said that: 
the amount of movement, especially the cardio workouts of audio trip, are absolutely fantastic! nothing makes you feel this sensation of dancing, if you let it flow. amazing really!

i already have the feeling, that synthriders and especially beat saber (where you mostly flick your handwrists/underarms) really do pale in comparison. so if you like to move your body, and want a full range of movement, this should definitely be on your radar! 
its an outstanding rhythm game with the benefit of even more and faster body movements throughout the cardio workouts.

although the quality of the songs is really great, i wish i could buy more songs as dlc to support the development of audio trip.

and seeing that the developers are constantly updating, gives me hope for even more ""fitness"" dance/cardio-workouts... (come on!)

one more thing: 
at first i was anxious about the movement and that it might make me feel queezy (since i'm still prone to motion sickness, even after all these years...). but there is a comfort mode and it totally works!

"this game is a great idea, but a few things should be fixed before it becomes a perfect game:
- grabbing items and moving them can lead to the game glitching and for the item to get stuck in the air and the teleporting button disappears.
- moving around in the game can make you motion sick, even with just teleporting. i got very motion sick when i was trying to go up stairs, but apparently i didn't point the arrow at the very top of the stairs, because it literally picked me up and dropped me right where i was already standing. maybe it's better with free motion, but free motion makes me sick to begin with.
- you are supposed to be able to attach items to the a,b, x, and y buttons on your controller, but i it took a few tries before the game would register and work. i could not attach the metal detector.

some extra things to add are:
- color customization for the gloves, homes, and other misc items
- the ability to sit on chairs and other usable decorations

"[h1]experienced on the oculus rift with touch controllers[/h1]

you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/0k2wwdy6mrq

this is a nice adventure puzzle / escape room that feels more like a walking simulator because the puzzles are pretty easy. it has a nice atmosphere and you really do get a sense that you're on this adventure. unfortunately, this game is brought down by the poor visuals & the clunky controls and interactions.

locomotion is like an arm-swinger except you're pulling yourself forwards. it also has snap-turning and you do have to crouch down quite a bit for certain sections. the puzzles are not a mental challenge, however, there is a physical challenge. usually the challenge comes from having to use this type of locomotion versus quick reflexes or agility. luckily, the checkpoints are usually pretty generous and retries are quick.

whole game took me 35 minutes. while i enjoyed the atmosphere and this real sense of danger and adventure, the graphics were just too poor. there was poor lighting, poor textures, and just poor 3d modeling. the interactions were clunky and the physics were almost non-existent. in the end, i did have fun, but the game was ugly to look at.

[b]rate 6/10. if you can look past the ugly visuals, poor sounds, & clunky interactions (+ locomotion) .... there's a fun game to be had here. [/b]",1560570812,3,0,701724

"a nice escape room with horror elements (probably nothing for people easily scared) and a timelimit of 1h.

the puzzles are quite challenging. had to play it twice to beat it.

a main critic point is the flashlight as other stated. the batteries lying around everywhere (and there are enough for the 1h time) don't really look like batteries. i first realized that they are batteries when i accidentally put one in the back of the flashlight. so maybe the model should be changed that they look more like batteries.

also there is much stuff lying around you can not interact with most of it, which is a bit sad. so most of the things you can pick up are needed for solving the puzzles.

the game does not detect the left/right hands from steamvr. the first controller that has been powered on is the left hand. had to switch my controllers after starting the game and seeing my hands are wrong.

"i. hate. boxes.
i see them in my dreams, i see them in my nightmares, i see them on the curb walking to class. this world that we are all cursed to live in is filled with boxes. i was on the verge of a total breakdown. i had nowhere to turn...

and then i found beatsaber.
 
it was time to take back the world from the boxes. for dozens of hours i waged war on the boxes. battles were lost and won. after a few hundred battles all by my lonesome i had discovered a group of like-minded box slayers such as myself who compete for glory on the box slaying battlefield. these elite warriors had simply ran out of battlefields to fight on, so they created their own. they brought the fight to the boxes... after climbing the ranks of this clan of mighty warriors and eventually developing skills that rivaled their leader, taichidesu, i had simply lost the fight in my heart. the lines between good and evil began to blur. i began to question the cause. why am i still fighting? why can't i feel my arms? why is everything in japanese? why do i care about my pp so much?

"the price point is matched by the detail and vr interactions in the game. having seen a comment in the forum along the lines of 'yeah we thought about a pc release, but decided with all the vr interaction it just wouldn't work', ill throw my hat in and say the cost is justified. there's polish and detail, and given the limited market, i hope people can see my point of view.

i like the movement options presented, the ability to use arm swinging for running while still using smooth trackpad movement is a good thing, with running it adds the immersion, not so much while walking. only having played through the early levels it's hard to be critical of the darkness, and a few of those creatures coming at me at point blank range and having to take damage. had no real issues with the performance, had it on default high settings on a 1070. hard to say how great a game it is, i've a feeling if the developers follow the game through, then you'll likely be playing a very different game in 6 months anyway.

i wouldn't say i'm overwhelmed as yet, but i do think if the fps are you're thing and the whole survival gametype appeals to you, then show an intrest and maybe take a punt. the base game and way the devs have gone about making your personal space and presence in the world feel sophisticated is very well done.",1531662664,2,0,732081

"i borrowed a quest 2 and finally got a chance to play alyx.  the technical side of things was kinda rough for the first half of the game in that my quest 2 kept crashing at various points.  turns out connecting via a usb cable was the worst option for me, and i got it ironed out connecting wirelessly and adjusting a few settings.  the game is certainly of very high quality, but it still has that feel of vr newness that kinda pervaded the last big burst of creation for the niche.  my main experience with vr has been through the original psvr where i experienced all my ooohs and aaaahs turn into something else, so throwing around glass bottles and playing on a vr playground aren't really new and exciting to me anymore. 

thankfully, there is plenty of quality gameplay and puzzle solving to be had in alyx.  it feels like it is the first game in a series that would have become even better with a sequel or 2, but we've never gotten those.  as a result, it sorta stands in place with light decay and paint peeling still holding the title of ""greatest vr game of all time"" (and maybe always will be).  a major point in its favor is the very active mod-scene which produces extremely high-quality levels to play once you are done with the campaign.  i've probably put more time into playing story mods than the original game at this point.

i'm left wondering if i hadn't had any technical problems what i would think of the game, but that wasn't my experience.  someone else might score the game higher, but i'm giving alyx a 4 out of 5.  there's so much potential here and so much user-created content left to play, but it would have been nice to get a more ""completed"" package.  i would definitely play a sequel even if it isn't half life 3.",1711381789,0,,161440107

"graphics too blurry. weird shader effects. i had to disable the post processing.
too much fog. too bad i couldn't disable that one.

 sometimes in a scene there's fog, i turn around and the fog is gone.
no shadows, pixelated textures. quest controllers show up instead of index controllers.
little to no detail, no love. weak effects.
the teleport- and bloody-screen vignette overlays are also a little misplaced.

but the programming and gameplay mechanics are great. the progression system will keep you coming back over and over again. there really aren't enough vr games like this one.
although the difficulty is very unforgiving. you'll see yourself playing the same levels over and over again, yup that's rougelike,

at 24,50? imo the price is too steep. afterall it's a ""mobile phone"" port and especially the graphics are most of the time all messed up.

i made the mistake and launched hellsplit vr right after this.
i couldn't help myself but i had to laugh...  my vr felt transformed. ultra cristp image, sharp textures...such clear view. no silly fog and overall blurryness. it was like coming from nintento64 to a playstation5. that was such a downer to me.
don't get me wrong, simplistic graphics in vr can look good. but this game just doesn't do it.


please give us proper pcvr games for the money.

"at the time of this review it's 0.1 hours played.
how can i recommend this game at less than a minute into the actual game?
hmm let me just quickly narrate my experience which will assuredly take longer to read (let alone write) than my entire game experience.

i get through the tutorial and i'm thinking, ok this is kinda cool, i like the somewhat realistic ammunition reloading. graphics are nicely done. sound is great. ok let's see how it goes.

fade into me standing in the middle of the subway station and i hear someone shouting save me and a zombie tries to gnaw on his skull to get to his brains. i try to tell the zombie, ""uhh that guy was just chilling inside the subway with all these zombies around, i don't think he's got any brains, certainly not tasty anyway"".  well i try to save him anyway, but i'm guessing it's a scripted takedown to instill some fear in the player. pfffft. me not scared.

after wasting that zombie with poor taste (see what i did there) another one showed up, then another one and i'm thinking to myself...ok i got this. then there's more than one zombie coming for me and the audio is so spot on i'm twirling around trying to figure out where they are all coming from all the while fumbling my second ammo clip. the palpable adrenaline mixed with anxiety over my clumsy control (just call me mr. butterfingers) intensifies as now i'm too focused on reloading that the sounds are getting much too close for comfort.

so of course i do what any rational person would do and promptly decide, ""maybe i'll get back to this later, uhh i have to sleep soon"" and so i open up the menu and quit. 
well, that didn't go as planned as the shuffling sounds of the zombies and the screaming and ""braaaains"" kept playing even when i couldn't see anything as the game was shutting down. they kept getting closer and closer while i tell myself, it's just a game, it's not like they can eat you from the ears inside out all while chanting in my head, close close close close already.

well. thankfully i'm still alive to tell the tale.
i may have the guts to try this again, preferably not right before bed.

"early release. i really like this game and recommened to everyone that likes royale games like pubg or fornite. realize that this game is not those. if you want standout to be those, it's not, go play those if you want those. very well put together, it is still in development and the devs are doing well. 

pro- immersive, aiming is nice and feels natural, multiple movement options/locomotion are available, inventory easy to access, community is great and helpful

con- needs more weapons (all weapons are good, there is no excitement of finding a good weapon and no frustration of going into a house and getting that crappy gun), no option for attachments (the gun has optics or it doesn't), games are too quick, circle and zones move too fast, map is small (if the map is going to be small that is fine, allow more time before the zone gets smaller), not much strategy involved (think cod free-for-all because as soon as you land there are great weapons in every house), every structure has a good weapon or 3 (real example- 2 story house 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom. i found a sniper rifle, m4 (with optics), and an fn-p90 (with optics)). meds are always in the same place (green tents and the hospital), sniper rifle is not accurate always, way too much ammo, sometimes finding 90 rounds next to a weapon (takes away the strategy of ammo conservation and waiting for that perfect shot, ""spray and pray""), needs more players (maybe make the game cheaper, or allow a free trial, or a free weekend download, lower the price, etc. the more plaers you have the more suggestions that come in and the better a game will be (unless you're like cod and just ruin a game by doing whatever you want and not listening to the players)

overall i love this game, buy it, play it, join the community.",1526737397,0,0,698116

"holy horrible way to ruin an ip batman! was a huge fan of pierhead arcade 1 so was so hyped for this. however this is like playing an early alpha of pierhead arcade 1 vs a sequel!

first of all still no snap turn, can't interact with games like picking up the gun to shoot, or if there's multiple balls to grab it will only let you pick up one or sometimes none. i mean just everything is broken, everything. completely and utterly unplayable in any capacity, and only recognizes index controllers and not vive wands somehow. wow this is bad.

and launches at full price in the middle of steam summer sale. instant refund and no chance i will give this another try as the company clearly intended to make a cash grba off the reputation of their previous game and then run because nobody would release a sequel in this state",1561871301,3,0,580537
wasn't what i expected....,1646732619,2,5,699134
"tldr:
graphics are meh, gameplay is decent for combat, poor for everything else. performance is great (tested on recomended+ specs, see below). small patches to fix minor issues are anticipated, but most vr user experience issues seem baked in.

disclaimer:
i have gotten to riverwood and accepted the claw quest, i haven't left riverwood yet. all my experience is up to this point so far.

performance:
the game runs well. i have a 1070 and a 4790k (oc to 4.7ghz) on the vive and i can max out all ingame settings (though i turned off taa). super sampling makes a big difference, allowing you to see more detail for things 4+ meters away. it is not turned on by default. i recommend fiddling with settings when you start as you can likely crank out some extra quality without sacrificing fps.

graphics:
i would hesitate to say the graphics are great. they are base skyrim graphics in vr. its not a big deal for me, but it is pretty good for 2011 graphics ported into vr. its the vr equivalent of nintendo 64 era graphics on a modern monitor. the textures show their age, but are servicable.

gameplay:
beyond graphics, the gameplay is hit and miss. combat feels good, not great. it can be kind of clunky at times. the bow should be set up like in the archery demo in the lab, instead your hand is not perpendicular to the arrow, but offset about 15 degrees leading to difficulty for aiming (for me at least). i would assume this will be patched soon (note i am writing this the day after launch, it is likely to be patched after the first month).

non combat gameplay is bad. you have to press buttons and go through menus for everything. as has been said before, on a monitor, its no big deal, in vr, it doesn't unimmerse me, but its just really clunky. i am on the vive and the touchpads will often scroll over multiple items when i want to select the next item. hopefully this is patched, but this may just be controller firmware.

controls are not well explained. the basics of unsheathing your weapons, turning and moving are explained but nothing else. i discovered jump on accident (non-dominant grip). it took me about an hour to figure out how to sheathe my weapons (on vive its the menu button and grip on the dominant controller). i fortunately stumbled uppon the control to pick up objects. you can infact do this, like everything else it is clunky though. to pick up an item, hold the dominant track pad down (tapping this trackpad will place the item in your inventory). when you release the trackpad, the item drops. sometimes the item will drop while you hold the trackpad down.

summary:
if you haven't played skyrim before, this probably won't be a good way to experience it. its for those that have massive nostalgia for the original game. the game is servicable, but rough around the edges. it is skyrim ported to vr, not skyrim  remade for vr. i debated refunding it as i currently have just over an hour in game. i think i will keep it, but if you are on the fence, wait for the summer sale when it will likely hit 30-50% off. i recomend this game for those that have played skyrim and want to sight see skyrim from a new perspective, and the core vr enthusasts. for all other people, the non vr version is still the superior way to play the game.",1522758542,3,0,609837

"smash the synth is a paid vr game where you dodge stuff floating slowly toward you and hit stuff with the correct color hand.  it worked on my htc vive system, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  music was ok.  was sort of easy playing ( on dancing arena ) and the sessions ( only lasts three minutes ) are short.  tried it on the highest difficulty, not bad but everything does fly faster to you.  maybe if you hit each synth on each  keys they make correct sound, i think the dev mentioned that.
i guess this a one person dev game.  has a leaderboard, that is the only reason they made to play this game.  i had some problem with seeing which keyboard objects are black, red or grey, but could have been my colorblindness, the maps lighting and my vive.  the game has 6 maps and plenty of music from a musician.  i guess this is not a bitcoin miner and avast av checked it out.     there is only playspace movement, if you have big enough space you can easily dodge what needs to be dodged.   

maybe buy, only if you wanna support indie dev and musician.  not a ""game"" with long play value.

more pros: running around around with a pack of antlions never felt so good. using the left hand to carry around another gun turret from level to level in nova prospect was fun -- i was sad when they were gone after the teleport.

also: peeking around corners and throwing grenades or shooting without exposing my body is fun and far saver. :)

"4.0 out of 10.

updated review:
now enables you to tilt the gun angle, and no longer freezes every few seconds in the menus. only took a whole month to fix. great work, not!

but still a hugely flawed game. no left hand support and the visuals are broken. some textures, blood spatter, and words written on walls and floors appear disconnected with the surfaces. as if they are on different layer in the distance. it's very weird and distracting. staring at these faults a foot away and moving your head you can see they move seperately (parallax) as you move your head. it's throughout the game, it's really bad. how did they miss this?

without a doubt the biggest tripple a vr release flop of the year. get it and be prepared to be disapointed. over 2 months after release and it's still like this, what a joke.

updated review:
in it current release state i can't recommend.  some fundamental shoddy mechanics spoil the game.

1. the game freezes constantly in the menus.
2. right-handed only weapons.
3. game crashing.
4. fixed weapon angle. wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't fixed to a unnatural angle making it an awkward stretch on your wrist to aim down the sights.
4. trackpad location combines two movment methods at once, it's far too easy to operate the one you don't intend to use.

i haven't even played past the tutorial level which crashed at the end. some really bad basic and surprising problems at a basic level. i'm quite shocked to see this from a developer of this calibre. of course all these things are fixable and they do need to be addressed as they affect the game. i'm quite disapointed and won't return to this game until it's patched as i shouldn't be forced to battle poor game mechinics as it just sucks the fun out if it.

the game is in the works so its hard to comment on its current state. however it is going in the right direction. one thing that i would like to see in the future is better characters. the characters texture work is good but the edge flow is terrible leading in to issues with geometry deforming incorrectly and in vr its very notable. keep it coming.,1468259719,0,0,495930

"classic!

it is actually a classic vr experience. as it all started this thing was a hype on youtube and everyone saw crying people on camera (well actually you didn't see theme because of the oculus in their faces)
but everyone was terrified of the creepy possibilities that vr can give you.

aracnophic people be warned!
people which are scared of dinosaurs be warned! (its actually pretty cute <3)
and some other fears are included in the game.

it is a fun experience you can share with your friends but you have to wear headphones to get the best sound experience...
the sound design is great and mean by the way! well done!
the graphics are old and you have to live with non realistic graphics, which are anyway are working pretty good, because of the keyboard idea.
a little mean is it, that you have to go through everything again if you were scared, so that some not that brave people will maybe never see the ******* ending that the developer made for you.

fun fact if you saw the last thing they do inside the game, play it again and try to be prepared. it wont work because they were clever ;)

"i saw this game advertised and was rather excited to see it finally on the market, so without hesitation i purchased it, ready to try it out when i had a moment.

to say i was disappointed by what i was able to play would be a bit of an understatement.

now i know this thing says it's compatible with oculus rift so there could be a headset disconnect somewhere in there, but i played this with the oculus quest 2 and honestly, this was probably one of my more unenjoyable vr experiences.

i really, really wanted to like this game because i enjoy cooking and i liked the idea that this was all based on actual recipes and such, but the game itself was horribly glitchy and jumpy and made for an overall awkward gaming experience and this was just in the tutorial.

grabbing things was incredibly difficult when items would jump out of my hand, flicker like a strobe light and end up at odd angles no matter how i tried to hold the thing, items got in the way of other items and/or prevented me from pressing necessary buttons, the knife would scarcely work to cut anything and when it did, half the time it wouldn't cut where i was actually trying to cut and attempting to use some of the other utensils like the spatula just ultimately made it more frustrating try to complete tasks (i ended up using tongs to flip those damn steaks as i often do irl).

that aside, there was one task towards the end where i was instructed to ""taste the dish"" by placing my open ""hand"" in the pot to scoop up some of the dish to be sampled and bringing it to my mouth. no matter how many times i tried it just wouldn't work. that's about when i gave up and apparently achieved my ""broken items"" achievement just trying to get anything to work as it was supposed to.

i understand there will be bugs and glitches that always need to be sorted out with ports and new games so i'm not going to rush for a refund, but i hope the issues with the game can be resolved soon. i'd like to able to play this for more than half an hour!",1630040696,2,0,399785
"overall pretty fun, people are chatty and mostly respectful. there are some glaring issues currently however. people with big playspaces have a massive edge over others. i remember a match where i physically could not reach the other party because he just stood 7 miles back with a large sword. so against some people with larger playspaces it is literally impossible to win. and i am not exaggerating, i mean literally impossible.",1689605339,0,,142270730
"if you like platformers like crash bandicoot, you'll like this game. however, this game feels like it came from a small/new team of game developers because it lacks the polish you'd expect from the larger shops. 

putting the camera in ""free"" mode is a necessity. the default mode of ""locked"" camera is a good attempt, but you'll find yourself frustrated time and time again with the locked camera. you'll miss hidden collectables and even lose your character behind terrain. even with the free camera, there are some ledges you can't see, which will end up killing you.

the health/life system still makes no sense to me. every enemy kills you in one hit. you have some type of heart thing, but it doesn't seem to decrease when you die. a simpler life/health system would have been nice.

it's not always clear what terrain you're not allowed to touch. some innocent looking terrain will just kill you on contact. makes for bad level design.

most of the enemies should just be reworked. some enemy's attack with gas clouds. they have very little ""tell"" when they are about to release the gas, and it's hard to tell when the gas is gone enough to be safe. other enemies attack silently from range with no ""tell"". it's no fun playing against confusing enemies or being killed from far away enemies you didn't even know were there.

some shadows clip through walls/ceiling, which is confusing when you're trying to collect the item casting the shadow.

even with all the issues, i still had fun and don't regret the purchase",1641856860,5, ,272343

then, the controls for one player would stop working. in one run through, the tactical panel stopped being able to use the system interrupt feature (when it was required). when we restarted, in another run through, half way through the mission the helm offer station stopped working. no way to move the ship. we had two players leave the game, and then rejoin and swap roles, but that did not fix the problem.

"grimlord could end up being the definitive soulslike for vr. it's not a perfect game (hence the early access) but the potential is more than there. having played the older beta demos i can say that the experience has come a long way from where it started. i'll go over what i think needs improvement first, then get into aspects i'm really enjoying about the game so far.

having a player body is always a welcome addition to any vr game. the implementation here still needs quite a bit of work though. arm ik in particular is odd looking. the elbows stay tucked way to close to the body. there's also mesh and texture stretching that is very visually obvious from the player perspective. hoping to see a lot of polish done over development since the player body is something you will always see while playing.

similarly to the body i found the hand interactions to feel a bit less satisfying. it's great being able to grab weapons from basically anywhere, but it doesn't come without it's downsides. it's hard to choke up on the shaft of a sword for example without your pointer and sometimes middle fingers not gripping due to the cross guard preventing it. this is mainly a visual nitpick as the weapons do feel nice and hefty. something i wanted to make sure to point out regardless though as again... the hands are something the player sees constantly.

sound design in it's current state feels very placeholder. ambient music is basically non existent, and the music i heard for the first boss fight sounded very familiar. like i'm almost certain i've heard the same music in another melee vr title. many of the sound effects are pretty anemic as well. the loud clash when blocking an attack is probably the most satisfying sound effect in the game so far. everything else just gives off a free sound library vibe. armor sounds like tin cans. flesh is harsh and the same hit sound every time. audio is an area that definitely needs love during the early access.

some nice visual effects are implemented. the majority are pretty weak though. when you cut down enemies you get a very generic blood splatter and no real bleeding or blood gushing effects. enemy dismemberment is a nice addition, but it doesn't look, sound, or even feel as satisfying as i think it could.

animations look very stiff at times. i'd like to see enemies reacting more dynamically to my attacks. they stumble back on occasion but it looks more like i triggered an animation rather than it blending organically from the time my weapon hits them to the moment the animation activates. this is another aspect of the game i hope to see major improvement in. if they could make the animations and reactions look as smooth as a game like hellsplit: arena it would add so much to making the experience as a whole feel so much better.

that's the bulk of my gripes. so what do i like about the game?

scope and scale. you do not understand how refreshing it is to play a vr game that feels like a proper game. this isn't some wave survival sandbox. there's a story, voice acting, progression. reasons to actually play and explore. being able to allocate skill points on a nice big skill tree. varying ways of approaching play style based on how you want to play the game. whether you brute force your way through encounters. rely on stealth. or prefer to be an over powered battle mage. grimlord gives you options.

melee combat is what i personally rock with and it honestly feels great! the core foundation is solid and i expect it to continue evolving over time. blocking or parrying attacks is extremely satisfying. once you get the timings down you feel like an actual bad*** parrying, slashing, and dashing to dodge heavier attacks. it's a genuine workout at times which i love.

the world you explore is large but not needlessly complex. the layout is straightforward enough without feeling too generic. rough around the edges at the moment. another aspect i have no doubt will just get better over time though, and for the most part i dig the layout. bigger game worlds take time to flesh out. i give metalcat kudos for taking on such a large one in a sea of vr games that dare not to.

enemy variety is somewhat repetitive, but there is at least a nice slew of differing enemies for early access. undead, humans, skelly bois, and different bosses. i've only fought the first boss so far, but i'm looking forward to the others that i've seen via screenshots and old beta demos. i'm somewhat neutral on this as a whole though. there's plenty of things they can do to add more variety moving forward, but i'm not upset with what's currently available.

one of the coolest aspects of the game has to be the weapon crafting system. you find various blueprints and weapons during your journey that can later be used to create whatever suits your playstyle. you use physical interactions to pick and chose what parts you want and the type of weapon after which you ding a little bell. assuming you have all the proper materials the blacksmith with craft said weapon for you. it's just a really unique way of doing weapon crafting, and i'm so glad there's no laser pointer menus involved.

which brings me to another big positive. outside of the pause menu and talent tree, there are basically no laser pointer inputs. i absolutely despise laser pointers in vr games. i think they're lazy and leave so much physical interaction potential on the table. grimlord gets massive brownie points for not making me suffer through laser menus outside of a couple forgivable ones given what they're used for. physical interactions in vr is what the medium was made for and you cannot convince me otherwise.

voice acting is surprisingly good. some of the pacing feels maybe a little slow at times, but i think the awkwardness of the dialogue has more to do with a lack of ambient music than it does the va's performances. the devs have clearly invested in some proper talent and didn't just click the first few fivver offers. i'd actually be blown away if they did, but i doubt it. the va's are good!

overall i truly do think grimlord is a game that deserves vr users attention and investment. even if it doesn't end up being the best thing since sliced bread, the developers have proven to me (someone who's been skeptical since the initial demos) that they care about this product. i don't regret my purchase at all.

if you read this metalcat, i want you to know that i have very high hopes for grimlord. i have no doubt in my mind that the final product will be something truly special. even in it's current state i really like what's here. keep up the fantastic work and show the industry how it's done! :)",1688838389,0,,141617492

the controls are really hard to use. i can't move my gorilla where i want it to go. and sometimes it feels like my gorilla is flying, and that's not what gorillas do!

also, the game is kinda boring. there's not much to do except run and climb. and the other gorillas in the game don't talk or do anything interesting. they're just there.

i don't think gorilla tag is a very good game. it's too hard to play and not very fun. i'd rather play with my toy gorilla instead.",1682020439,0,,137020715

"... it's freaking myst in vr!!! i bought a cd-rom back in 1993 just to play the original, and from 93 to 02, i probably clocked a few thousand hours just exploring, sometimes i'd go into myst to relax and unwind and stare at things for hours. ever since i was a youngling, i had dreamed of being able to actually go into the myst book and explore the various ages for myself. now, i can. i don't care about taking notes, or having an inventory system. i've never had an inventory system in any version before now, so i don't need it here. it's already a huge advantage to be able to carry around things in a way that wasn't possible in the original game (such as taking a library book *out* of the library to an actual puzzle like the rocket ship piano), and oh nooo i have to destroy my immersion for a second to switch to a notes app on my quest 2, or lift up my headset for a moment to write something down... that means the developers are awful!  oh, wait, literally every other version of myst that i've played, i've had to *look away* from the game and break immersion to take notes. huh. how about that?

hands down, this is the game i have been waiting for since 1993. i have dreamed of walking the rope bridges of the channelwood age since i was a kid. now i freaking can! i almost wept when i started exploring the world of myst in vr. it blew my mind. this is the single thing i've been dying to do ever since the whole vr craze in the 90s that took over 30 years to finally pan out. 

so to the developers - thank you. sincerely. you made all of my childhood dreams of myst a reality. i can only hope that as the hardware improves, myst vr will get a 'photorealistic' update and look even more incredible (maybe it already does in the pcvr version, haven't launched it on quest link yet)",1650228960,5,"Thank you so very much for these kind words and this great review, TeknowViking!

it's early access, so i know the game will get light years better and i'm rooting for it.  i just had a pretty frustrating, and not so fun time with it.  it needs to be more casual, more fun to get in and get into flow state.  also the songs i have heard so far are not that great, they don't inspire the player to kill it, to stay in that groove.  they are just not great songs at all, which might actually be my biggest worry.  

right now in it's early state i would have to say wait a bit while they dial things in.  if you've soaked up all of beat saber maybe pick it up, try it out.",1552119537,3,0,367046

you can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/zievypnntwg

as far as minecraft clones for vr, this one is pretty solid. it looks & runs good for the most part. however, it may be a little too much of a clone and not enough original. however, that's for mojang studio's or microsoft's lawyers to figure out, not me. this game has actually been out on mobile and steam for several years, so it's unlikely that vr would change it's status as a game that can make a profit on steam.

i had fun playing this game. it plays almost exactly like minecraft. i honestly couldn't say what the differences are. i think the creatures look better in this version. you can choose creative mode or survival mode. in creative you just make whatever you want. in survival, you have to prepare for the night and collect resources and unlock stuff.

if i do have a criticism, other than the lack of originality, it is that the interactions are all point and click. so you don't swing your sword, you aim with your laser at the enemy and press trigger over and over. you can actually do sword combat from quite the distance, making the game a bit easy. it would be nice to have to swing from melee distance to cut down trees, mine minerals, and for melee combat. 

game is running on the unity engine. on my rtx 3080, i was getting a steady 90 fps. you do have full locomotion or teleportation, along with smooth or snap turning (you can choose speed / degree, although even the fastest was still not quite fast enough for my taste). you can play comfortably seated since you do everything point & click. you're supposed to be able to fly by double-tapping the a button, but that never worked for me. i tried every button.

if you like minecraft and always wanted a cheap clone version on steam, well, this is your somewhat questionable budget game. just beware, it is at least 90% just like minecraft, for better or for worse.

matches the same level of interactivity and immersion as other leading vr titles like alyx, once you introduce mods. the modding scene has really propelled this game to be something quite special when it comes to vr interactions and makes it a worthwhile experience. due to this game being on the market for over a decade modding has been significantly streamlined to the point that there are now installers which will fully overhaul the game with all of the 'required' vr mods included making it a relatively stress free experience. with that said i would not recommend it at full price as it requires efforts on behalf of the customer in order to make it an enjoyable vr experience. bethesda put forth the absolute bare minimum with the port of this title and slapped a full retail price on it. when it goes on sale, then i would absolutely say go for it. marking this as a no due to too many caveats for straightforward recommendation.",1672330480,0,,129614807

"post-aftershocks: now the game is even more worth the dollar/euro. for me, as i really took my time for the new missions it were 10hrs of free extra gameplay. and the end is a neat teaser for the next update or dlc i guess. keep it coming! in need more missions, guns, zombies¡­ more everything. love this game!

pre-aftershocks: i bought this game right after unpacking my quest 2 and it was a huge mistake.
not because the game is bad, but because all the games i bought after twdss are fun - but not as fun as saints and sinner. at least so far.

the free updates keep it worthwhile to come back and check even after finishing it multiple times.

the main storyline could be a bit longer, yes. the variety of stuff to be found in the world could be more diverse, yes.

but still, it¡¯s unbelievably satisfying to throw blows at zombies and headshot bad humans. and even after 30hrs ingame, dark corridors give me chills, no matter how good my loadout is.

only thing that really bothered me is the ki on the quest version.
even when in the middle of a camp, shooting one enemy after another does not trigger the rest. the only way to get in real trouble is being spotted visually. thats really immersion breaking.",1665682560,5, ,240266

"windlands is a great game. the movement is very smooth and not nausiating for me at all.

here are a few hints though: i encourage you to never use the right analogue stick, at all. not for smooth turning, not on comfort turning. if you must use it, put it on comfort, but in general, stand up and actually turn around. this one change will make a huge difference.

next, turning on comfort cage is a good idea, mostly to keep track of where your character is, keeping you from wandering too much as you turn.

remember, vr nausia is cumilative, so you need to start it right. if you try to use smooth turning, then turn it off, you will not lose your nausia, it will continue to get worse, even if you have it comfortable settings. play it on comfortable from the start, and if you feel fine after an hour, at your own risk experiment. this is why many newer games, like eagle flight, don't even allow you to turn off comfort settings, because someone will, not understanding the consequences, and blame the game.

i have been sick from playing games with poor vr controls, like technolust, but the game is smooth and predictable. as others say, you character slides a tiny amount when he stops, which is a very natural movement and not jarring like it would be if the stop was immediate.

gameplaywise, its very exhilerating. soaring through the sky, timing and getting the right swings or hitting the right ground is a rush. its really great.

also, not repetitive. this game is hard and ups the ante at every world. the fundamentals stay the same, but the challenges are varied and increase steeply. this is not an easy game, and  it doesn't teach you how to play. but its not hard to learn either.

"a super satisfying game in multiple ways:
- cinematic quality visuals. it literally feels like i'm in a medieval epic war movie -- like game of thrones.
- low stress. i'm normally a scaredy cat when it comes to dark visuals, but this game is remarkably soothing and relaxing to play. i haven't seen any jump scares through the second level.
- the powerups just make the game increasingly satisfying to play. slow motion, etc.

this feels like a triple-a title. and what's more, it's the only triple-a title i don't feel much anxiety when playing. for example, with ""half-life: alyx"" and ""saints & sinners"", there's a strong element of fear.

"evil abounds!

1. can't crouch without a button press which breaks all immersion. why? were you supposed to play sitting? try swinging an ax while sitting. leading cause of the lack of ax murderers in a wheelchair movies imo.

2. weapons physics think i have the physical strength of a malnourished 10 year old. i though boneworks underestimates my physical strength. this game makes swinging a two handed weapon feel like i'm fighting underwater.

3. weapons are made of cardboard. they must be or they would last longer than a handful of attacks.

4. the melee feels clumsy. this seems to be the result of: 1) the character model not fitting the player's real world body. 2) the inability to move vertically very much without the game bring the game world up or down with the player. 3) the weapons being too ""heavy"" and, in some cases, too large. 4) the weapons breaking waaaaaaay to easy. 5) finally the stamina system which is not needed in vr since the player will get tired themselves if you just give them a bunch of enemies, fair odds, and weapons make of wood instead of cardboard.

"great game, great feel. the swordplay is tight and responsive, with solid physics. it's more a bundle of mechanics at the moment, with nothing in the way of story or progression, but it'll easily last hours of just mercilessly beating the light out of the eyes of your enemies. and for a bundle of mechanics, it's amazing. anything you think you should be able to do, you can probably do it. block, parry, punch a fireball into a dudes face, force choke them like darth vader, tear them apart with magic, tear them apart with an ax, catch their weapon with an ax, catch their face with an ax, it's got everything. highly recommended, and a must have for any vr headset

edit!: i wrote that review a long time ago now, and the game has done nothing but improve. the guys over at warpfrog have worked tirelessly to better this project, from consistent communication, consistent and quality updates, and even employing modders from their community. it really does feel like this game is *the* vr grass roots, indie game success story, and the fucking thing isn't even done yet. the combat remains the industry standard for quality sword fighting, and i can confirm with confidence, that blade and sorcery is an inarguable must have for any vr headset, hands down",1607033803,3,3,661383

"here is a review about the best game on quest.

graphics: these graphics are really cartoonish and great. it is not at all ugly.

length of the game: the length of this game is pretty short. this is the top and only problem with this game. and after a while you¡¯ll get bored of this game

gameplay: messing around with the robots is really fun. there are 4 jobs, auto mechanic, office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk. all of these jobs are really fun and silly. you get to blend grape juice bottles, throw gum at customers, make a silly presentation, and ruin a car. and those are just 1percent of the stuff you get to do in this game. it is a lot more fun than you think. and each job takes around 45 minutes to complete. and just when you think you are done with this game and there is nothing to do, a scientist comes and mods such as low gravity, bouncy mode and dollhouse mode(it makes you giant and everything else smaller.) and there is even night shift which has infinite tasks. let me give you a short description of each job.

auto mechanic: you get to do whatever you want to a customers car and fulfill the customers request.

gourmet chef: you get to cook disgusting food and serve it to weird customers.

office worker: you get to eat donuts, play games on a computer, have a party, make a silly presentation, duplicate anything you want, and more.

store clerk: you get to eat customers food, give a child illegal fireworks, and trade a winning lottery ticket for a half eaten burrito.

conclusion: thank you for reading my review. this game may get boring over time but oh boy is it silly and has a lot of content. buy this game and thank me later. this game should cost 25 dollars in fact. i love this game and highly recommend you buy it. plus if you don¡¯t like you can return it.
and one last thing to the game makers plz make more jobs!",1617593014,5, ,268800
"incredible.  in the spirit of other rhythm games this does not teach you to read wrote music, but it simulates the entire conducting experience in an outstanding way.  it boils down to meter, tempo, dynamics, instrument cues, but it mixes it with the regular conductor forms and is real-time dynamic in its feedback to the player (i.e., if you miss a cue or a beat, you will actually hear it).  incredible experience, loving it.  from the tutorial/easy modes that show you where to conduct and where to point to cue in instrument groups, to the ""realistic"" mode that takes everything away and just lets you conduct based upon the music (and an inherent understanding of the mechanics in the game).

there's not a lot of room for independent motion, as it sets the baseline/middle ground for your downbeat, but the recordings are great for midi/vst (as expected for a game that allows parts to drop out or come in based upon player interaction).  outstanding practice for anyone interested in learning the ""basics"" of conducting everything from a string quartet to a full symphonic orchestra.

i am waiting with bated breath for more songs to be included as well as a wider range of cues at the ""hard/realistic"" levels.  the biggest gap is catalog of music.  it looks like there is more, but i have not figured out how to unlock it even with competency at realistic levels.  there appears to be unlockable content that i am hoping is included with future updates as this moves on from early access.  i wish the developers speed and grace in their future implementation and can't wait for more songs to conduct!",1676242799,0,,132741906

"as killing floor was one of the first games i bought on steam many years ago, i knew what i was getting into, i'm yet to play multiplayer but i hope that the trader system is still evident, that was great fun back in the day.

anyway, the story. 
   it was simple, immersive, and very easy to understand and navigate. little short for the price even when it was on sale, but it's mainly a multiplayer kind of game. but as for the plot of the story, the endings were incredibly poor. voice acting was great though. could have done with some more puzzles, those hacking systems were easily done by jerking your hand back and forth (spicy) and rotating it clockwise and anti-clockwise (ooh very nice). but basically, don't get this game if you're wanting a solid story which you can sink your teeth into, it's poor quite frankly.

as for mechanics,
    everything seemed to work fine for me and my oculus rift, melee was a little easy since you can just shake your shit around (naughty) would like to have had a manual reload system instead of some phantom putting in your magazine and bullets for you. had one movement issue where i literally just teleported to a part of the map that i needed a keycard to access, therefore trapping me outside the play zones and i had to restart the game. like the touch of adding both types of locomotion too, movement system seems good, but sprinting would be nice, unless i don't know something.

overall, it's a multiplayer game, with hours and hours of replayability, and it's virtual fucking reality, what more can you say.

story spoiler ahead!
[spoiler] i was expecting to be able to fight the patriach at the end, but alas, it wasn't to be, and you only get to see him if you choose the bad ending? poor choice. i wanted to get back into my body, out of simulation, fight my way to the patriach alongside foster and save humankind myself instead of just assuming it. but whatever, it's a multiplayer game after all.",1515462887,0,0,686386

"amazing! ??????????

although it's lacking in water, lakes and waterfalls, (hopefully still to come?) cyubevr still looks 'jaw dropping gorgeous' as it is right now! 

the developer has a 'touch for detail' and has included detailed lighting and realistic looking animals. the landscapes are rich and dramatic with staggering high mountains (and floating ones too!) all covered with beautiful trees, flowers and grass.

you will be presented with blue skies by day and a large moon and the aurora borealis at night! (snow and rain are also available).

to cut a long story short - the graphics look amazing and cyubevr plays well and feels good using the vr controllers. the landscapes and graphics are so magical and the controls so good, i found myself spending hours of enjoyable gameplay unable to stop!

let us not forget cyubevr is still growing -  with survivor mode (including enemies) and multiplying arriving in the near future!

"after trying the demo for interworlds. i became very interested in what the creator would do with the mechanics (mini world especially) and unfortunately i cannot recommend this game at this time. 

pros : (they are there!)
the concepts are sound, and the visuals impressive for an early stage of development. the creator has even updated the visuals to be more framerate friendly even with ragdoll physics. the levels feels lush and like they didn't just slap some geometry together.

but what it has in flair it lacks in substance.
cons : 
mechanically right now this game is clunky, and not player friendly. controls are locked unnecessarily when tools are present. thinking outside the box isn't rewarded, and certain in-game interactions conflict with the theme the game is trying to promote. let me present some examples.

the mini world offers players the opportunity to  move much larger objects than themselves, and it creates some fun interactions with the world. one part lets you place a bridge across an otherwise unpassable river. one part lets you use a massive block as cover from a handful of archery goblins! however, my phrasing is deliberate when i say it ""lets you"" do these things. what if you try something new? lets use the bridge on a different part of the riverbank to get behind the goblins... nope, it locks into place to create the only traversable walkway. what if you want to use that large block to smash the goblins instead of use it as cover? nope... passes right through them. what if i want to teleport or quickly access mini world with my sword hand? nope gotta un-equip the sword first. no ""auto-sheath"" function, really? and you can only access many features from pedestal boxes with the necessary piece you need for the obstacle. for example, a ""boss"" stands between you and the end of the level, and you qickly find your sword is useless. instead you are offered a fireball spell that needs to be pulled from the box for each use. standing still means the boss doesn't even kill you however, so it's not very threatening. just another exercise in tedium to finish exactly what the game intends you to do.


tldr:
this game has great potential, but someone with some game design background should work with the creator to flesh out the mechanics and breath some life into this already potential filled project.  as it stands however, i find it unplayable due to being bland and nit-picky about what you're allowed to do at any given moment.",1513369300,3,0,691081

"¡°the room¡± is what i¡¯d guess is a pretty standard vr-type puzzle game:  you¡¯ll manipulate this thing over here to get a strange artifact with an indented base which will fit perfectly in a recess over there...etc.  but man alive does it have atmosphere!  and that elevates it into something special. 

you¡¯ll spend your time as a gaslamp-era british police detective in one of five different environments during this game. each of these is riddled with interlocking puzzles, and each of these is incredibly well crafted.  the walls look solid and cold, the fires look hot, the details are beautifully modeled with excellent textures. the sounds are mysterious and suggestive. 

all of this became so transporting that more than once i tried to use a virtual table as a real one or reached out to touch a wall that wasn¡¯t there. i was that involved with the world and that table looked so dang solid!

my enjoyment of the game was really all about appreciating these transporting environments. there is an extremely mysterious story in there which may or may not make sense (maybe i¡¯ll have to play through again?) and some of the items you find will be magical, and¡ªas i¡¯ve said¡ªits pretty basic puzzle solving (ample hints are available) but more than once i felt a chill go down my spine as something activated, or i felt crazy smart when i opened up a box or reached a new area.

"boxvr is an adequate game with massive potential and thus falls short of where it should be.

it has a solid premise overall - punch, dodge, duck, block, [u]repeat[/u]. these actions are all performed in various combinations throughout the game and, with the assistance of music, you can easily spend an hour of your life burning calories in a consistent flow.

however, there are numerous bugs and flaws that inexplicably exist for a game that has been in release for almost a year and with such a massive budget. for one, i am unable to change the room's center. every button combination and restart i tried would not yield a different result. the ""winter"" map is extremely foggy and rather spooky because the effects do not load properly. the ""block"" action indicator design is dissociated from the actual action and placed poorly within the map, resulting in more than 1 block action in a row being fully blocked by the closest. the dodge and ducks are dependent not simply on distance and location but also your momentum, and there is no way to know when you are performing the action correctly. i was able to flick my head to ""avoid"" them by performing quick movement but alternatively move extremely far away. beat saber solves this problem by simply requiring the user to not be within a ""wall"" and makes them transparent so you have visibility at all times. there is also no way to know when you are able to strike spheres, as strangely enough they cannot be interacted with too far in front of the player. when coming out of custom playlists you're shunted back to the menu instead of where you left off.

in addition to gameplay affecting flaws, the ui is also extremely minimal and lacks many potential quality of life features. you cannot reorder songs in a playlist, for example, or even scroll through them. there is also no list of custom music that has already been converted, so you have to navigate through the windows filesystem via the rather rough ui to add music to a new playlist.

i'd also criticize the reward system as you are not at all rewarded or encouraged to perform the correct movement in a given situation. i slapped all the jabs and blocks through an entire song because it doesn't matter how you interact with a jab - it only matters that you have given the controller enough velocity to ""collide"" with the sphere.

the only feature of boxvr that is significantly meaningful is the custom playlist feature/song importer. due to the simplicity and low number of actions you perform in-game, custom converted tracks are completely adequate to create a daily routine from.

if you are considering boxvr, there are many alternatives with both active developers and communities that are invested in their respective games: beat saber, synth riders, and pistol whip, or, if you want accurate boxing, the thrill of the fight.",1586821139,4,2,671598

a little feedback on survival mode: i think one should be able to turn off the objective that is required to be protected, as this is a major point of failure for most attempting extremely long survival runs.

i also think that you should have npc allies in survival as maybe an unlockable perk. they can either respawn each round or be required to be purchased each time (your choice) 

overall, i think survival should be closer to mw3 survival, as well as have more maps. (i'm sure more survival maps are planned) however based on the way it was designed i think it was designed to not be like mw3 survival?",1664621820,5,"Hey,

buy this program if you are looking for mindful spaces in vr.

"+ nice atmosphere
- dated graphics
+ progression system that makes the game harder
- no proper way to tune down difficulty if you want to chill other than wiping everything
+ everything is designed around it being a vr archer game with various types of arrows and effects
- the locomotion feels gimmicky at best:  to teleport you either throw a shard with at most the power of a 5 year old, or shoot a special arrow; smooth locomotion is snail's speed at best

all in all it's still a fun game if you're into (vr) archery, roguelikes and don't mind or even like the restrictive locomotion. personally the latter is not for me at all.

however, the glaring issue as most other people have pointed out is that the devs abandoned the game on steam. independently i'd argue this game finished development. however, seeing how the devs went on to continue development on it for the oculus store while the steam version is not getting any of the new content and features feels like a slap to the face.",1621766252,3,0,596815

"i got this as ""tetris in vr"", but it's so much better than tetris. moving in a 3d space, you can turn those pesky z-blocks around to make them s-blocks. you can also fill holes left so long as the shape will fit it. the capacity concept is the only flaw, and i saw this even before the purchase (i bought this on sale). in classical tetris the rate of the blocks increases with the number of lines you complete. in kubz vr the rate increases automatically but does reach a maximum. basically, as long as you can keep up with the max speed you can keep playing, but don't expect to do that without breaking a sweat. it does have leaderboards, but they are local. online leaderboards would be a great addition.",1493841478,3,0,513760

the game itself looks beautiful and is animated to nearly perfection.
physics and colliders in this game are so realistic that u can play arount with each singel foot of a headcrab after u killed it.

the gameplay itself is optimized for vr as far as possible. i just miss one thing: smooth turning, i didn`t find a way to activate it. 
beside that, its very good. especially when a zombie is approaching and u are fiddeling around with your gun to reload. 
there are some jump scares in the game, that keep your eyes open and your nerves tense. the good sound just underlines the seceneray. 

time is relative in this game, 2.5h feel like nothing. never got into a vr game this deep (not even in stormland).

"i really tried to like this game. true room-scale vr games, that adapt to your play space, are few and far between, and this is probably the most popular and highly-rated of them all (yet). sadly it is just not a good game. it is a series of spooky environments with 'escape room' type environmental puzzles, which are either entirely straightforward and obvious or entirely unintuitive/hidden and will require you to use the built-in hint feature (eg. when you have a key and the keyhole is tiny and near the ground in an entirely unusual place, that there is no other in-game direction towards).

it's pretty buggy in a variety of ways, but especially in things failing to trigger (or taking extremely long, random amounts of time to trigger), which can be especially bad when it's only apparent on repeated attempts. for this reason as well as seeming physics bugs, there were multiple major puzzles which just didn't work right the first time, at least once requiring reloading the scene. the way certain objects attach to your hand or even just behave in the world is very physics-glitchy and off-putting. the hmd:environment collision fade is too aggressive, several times getting in the way of close examination of the environment. the game repeatedly commits what should probably be recognized as a big sin (when running in adaptive room-scale mode) of putting objects you're supposed to react with directly at the borders of the play area, and tends not to do much with the majority of the volume in the center.

the story is a classic type of ambiguous paranoid psycho-thriller intrigue, presented and developed [i]excellently[/i] throughout the entire game - for the most part. the framing narrative interludes in your prison cell, where you are given the opportunity to re-read one old note selected from each completed level and to advance by guessing which bird statue to touch, are as goofy and pointless as that description makes them sound. it is intriguing enough to make you want to keep going (with enough little environmental storytelling hints to make it pretty clear what's happening), right up until it suddenly stops with a massive expository monologue and then a brief newspaper clipping.

this is one of the worst vr horror experiences i've had (and not in any good way), which i think is really telling. i'm not sure how well suited this style of slow, deliberate escape-room puzzle-solving is to horror. at no time in this game did i feel threatened, or like there was any possibility of failure (there isn't).

at the $12.50 sale price i got it for, i'm not exactly [i]pissed[/i], as i probably would have been getting it at full price. same for my having played it post-'remaster', i can't imagine what it must have been like before if this is the 'remastered' version. but for a full playtime of ~3 hours, with no obvious replay value (one possible alternate ending?), and with all the aforementioned problems, i absolutely do not recommend it.",1541009984,3,0,453304

-scary like the original game
-mechanics that give the game that flair
-you can experiment with items and easter eggs are also included.
-flick of a switch scary to hilariously funny
-graphics are nice to look at

cons:
-lag, bad lag.
-no audio settings, bass boosted my ears into the 25th dimension when i opened the game
-(minor) cannot pick up chairs, they gravitate away from you
-173 spawn occasionally screws up and kills you instantly

the weapons are fun to use, they've also made the weapons more realistic, for the ar2, you actually need to swap the magazine instead of having a single pellet change which is a reasonable change. the weapons have the +1 system.

"my bone works 




nah, but seriously. boneworks is an incredibly immersive vr combat experience in which you battle through a variety of different enemies while solving some fun physics puzzles. image half-life vr but not half-life. (the headcrabs are terrifying.) the arena mode and sandbox mode will add hours upon hours of incredible fun in which you get to further mess around with the great fully body physics that the game features and the massive variety of weapons that you can collect along the way. the climbing can be a bit strange at times such as getting up onto objects but other than that,  my only other complaint is that the game's story isn't longer than the 11 hours (still rather long for a vr campaign mind you) that i joyfully spent crushing, stabbing and shooting ai while fearing for my life.

tldr:  
physics good, killing good, enemies good, levels good and robot head crabs terrifying. 

final verdict:
best vr game i have ever had the joy of experiencing.

"song in the smoke is an excellent game, and well priced for $30.

it may soon list here that i've refunded the game. that is because i'm counting pennies and decided i can't justify spending the money right now. my situation is anomalous (compared to most pcvr users). you should buy it for $30. i very literally only drink tap water and never ever buy prepared meals, so i'm allowed to say that!!! 

i thoroughly enjoyed my first 1.5 hours with the game, even despite some controller binding issues with the g2 (this is a solved issue - it's expected these will be fixed in a patch soon, but also i've made a public binding for other g2 users that fixes the problem, so just select my public binding if the patch hasn't come yet).

the game looks beautiful on the g2. it runs well. the crafting was engaging, the world was immersive, and felt like a world i wanted to spend more time with and learn more about.

i only got a small abstract introduction to the story. so i can't comment much about what i feel about the story.

the devs have been adding patches regularly since the game released on psvr a couple months ago.

song in the smoke seems like a polished, immersive, lengthy & replayable (from everything i've heard), interesting adventure survival story game made for vr. it got some stellar reviews on psvr and it seems to me this is for good reason.

i highly recommend it.",1640067077,2,2,427110

"i would really like to individually give star ratings to different portions of the game. so i¡¯ll leave the average at 4.

5 stars- i don¡¯t know why people are complaining about the avatars. they looks cool and the game is absolutely beautiful. the graphics are by far some of the best vr has to offer. the graphics are extremely smooth and is absolutely amazing to say the least. easily the most impressive part of this game. also i¡¯ll give 5 stars to tennis. it¡¯s very nice and a great workout. the ¡°scramble¡± settings are pretty annoying so having the ability to turn that off leaves it at 5. the hard mode is also extremely hard and a real challenge!

3 stars- baseball at first was the best part of the game and easily 5 stars. but once you play it a bit more it becomes¡­ bland. you can only pitch and hit. no fielding or base running makes it old pretty quickly. i wish it was a bit more immersive rather than standing in one spot the entire time either making a basic pitching motion or swinging with one hand. the game is so basic once you get the hang of it you can pretty much mop the floor with any opponent even on ¡°hard¡± settings. the best part about baseball isn¡¯t doing even the gameplay. it¡¯s the feeling of being in a crowded baseball stadium that¡¯s actually live sized. it¡¯s really amazing and immersive sight and sometimes i¡¯ll jump into a game simply to witness it. easily one of the coolest feelings you can get while playing vr.


2 star- bowling. it¡¯s not even really bowling. it¡¯s just a minute or so timer and you continuously throw balls (or other objects) at a lane. it¡¯s more of a mini game if anything. less than impressive for sure. i¡¯ll give it 2 stars just for the fact it¡¯s an extra element to the game and it was actually pretty funny the first time i played it. but seems pretty thrown together and last second as if they the developers had a deadline and needed to add a third ¡°sport¡±. would it have been that hard to add real bowling rules ? seriously ? 

1 star- well i wouldn¡¯t say much if any of the gameplay belongs in the one star but there are some killers to this game that make it really annoying. first is the loading screen. jeez it takes forever . getting from place to place too in the game can be a hassle as well. it makes you continuously turn while you choose settings which is extremely frustrating. 

0 star - yep, there is an absolute game killer to this. multiplayer. why you ask ? well. it¡¯s non existent. which sucks. i actually feel like baseball and even possibly bowling would be more fun if i could find someone online. i¡¯ve tried dozens of times and had success twice. obviously the online side of this game is dead which is a real bummer because honestly, it would make the game a 5 star game. thanks to no multiplayer you¡¯re kind of stuck in offline mode. which the only consistent playable thing to play offline is tennis. and baseball once in a blue moon. i feel like if they just did a massive update and advertised it then it could possible spark an online community, however that seems extremely unlikely 


all in all. the game is $30 for a really great game of tennis. amazing graphics. an average game of baseball and a horrible version of bowling.",1664509860,5, ,307110

"i was one of many people sceptical about a half-life game being vr exclusive, after over a decade waiting for episode 3 or hl3, but i'm glad i gave it a chance, thanks to the oculus quest 2 being so affordable for a vr headset.

the game is an incredibly immersive  experience, the highs are when it is throwing you into moments of horror; like having to use a flashlight on your hand to see in complete darkness, while headcrabs and zombies try to kill you or the hide and seek chapter with jeff. 

the lows in my opinion are the combat sequences against the combine, if it's not in a corridor of some sort, since the combine are incredibly slow to flank and move very slowly, but the heavy armor and smg wielding combine hit hard, so you have to take cover, the only problem is that it get's quite simplistic to defeat them  and they can become a nuisance after a while, as it can take quite a few bullets early on in the game, with very little weapon upgrades to kill them.

overall though, this is a must play to the end for people wanting an amazing introduction to vr or half-life fans who have been waiting for episode 3 or hl2. even playing through virtual desktop wirelessly with my quest 2, it worked flawlessly with my setup.

"i always review two weeks after purchase. usually by then i find multiplayer games have worn off a little bit. 
however, nock didn¡¯t. 
it is an amazing day with a growing player base at the time of writing this. the gameplay aspects are clearly well-worked but not overdone. it is a good game. but a lot of games are good. 
the thing that¡¯s keeps multiplayer games going is the multiplayer aspects. if you have no players you have no lobbies. if you have no lobbies you have no players. ultimately that¡¯s what it comes down too. how long can nock hold the consumers attention. 
aside from this,
nock is amazing and it is what vr needs. a great, non-combat e-sport. the more e-sport games made for vr, the more people want to play vr. the more people who play vr. more lobbies, bigger communities. this is a very healthy game for vr.

and a very entertaining game overall¡­ 

if i had one complaint, it would be the late night matchmaking and ranked. i feel that ranked play should be done through a ranked game mode rather than the basic game. the way it currently is, casuals play pros. this means casuals will get mad and quit, then pros will quit because they don¡¯t have worse players to beat. this becomes even worse at night as there are less players online so you usually end up playing someone a lot better. 

if they fix this i would definitely consider putting it on the same level as twd: s&s.

aside from this, it is a polished and well priced game. 

currently my second favourite vr game, just below twd: s&s

-spawns are way harder to dodge but give a short opening to attack just before attacking
-so far the 2 playable areas are super large

i'm a relatively new player to vr and this game was one of my first purchases. this game is really fun and exciting and definitely gets the adrenaline pumping. the only issue i have with the game is that i'm left handed and there is no option to choose the dominant hand for the main weapon used in the game. i would gladly recommend this game to anyone but i can't give it 5 stars until this option is added or taken into consideration on future updates.,1617679414,5, ,84855

"i want to start off by saying that i really enjoyed this game. it felt a bit like the beginning of no man's sky, but without as much grind, and a fun puzzle-based twist. it was a fun, albeit short, romp around an alien world, and i wouldn't hesitate to play (and pay for) another game with the same concept, but extended. the combination of moving between disparate rooms in a seated experience was the key part of this that i enjoyed the most.

however, i felt nauseous after playing this. i don't think enough of the player's periphery was blocked by the sides of the hover-ship when traveling (periphery blocking during movement is what reduces nausea in many other games.) the moving elevator also had some effect, but i suppose not nearly as intense.

overall, i recommend this game, and i hope that the developer continues to make similar roomscale/seated experiences. i just would like him to include comfort options for mobility in the future.",1505693363,0,0,616889

"obligatory: i don¡¯t have kids but i¡¯m an adult who plays.

the game is a fantastic place full of wonderful worlds with amazing views and things too do. for adults. vrchat itself was never intended for minors and has made that very clear every chance they can. the main four worlds most people know (the black cat,great pug,room of rain,and clubb) are all clubs/bars with the exception of room of rain which is a chill house like environment with a bath tub and plenty of booze, almost like a romantic get away location. vrchat worlds are often publicly populated with people from around the world, and with that you get a world of different views which conflict and coexist with eachother many people are good wholesome and kind. but for every 1 wholesome person there is 1 who is unhinged.unfortunately that includes shady characters who may actively harm children given the chance/opportunity.one such person who was outed has been publicly ostracized ridiculed and is now thankfully in psychiatric care. but there¡¯s no telling who else could be waiting silently in the shadows. as with all online communities 1 bad egg spoils the whole bunch. believe me when i say if kids werent allowed on this game there would be a lot less issues in the world. including in the game itself. 

the issue with vrchat is not the game itself, it¡¯s that there are no ways of checking weather or not someone who claims to be an adult js one. except that most 10 year olds immediately make themselves known to be 10. but by that time it¡¯s too late. because by then they have accessed a place they shouldn¡¯t be.",1650300300,5, ,79993

"have you ever wanted to learn how to paint?  well here it is, vermillion puts that dream into action with this gorgeous app, one of my favorites.  with practice you'll get a feel for brushstrokes and how acrylic paint interacts on canvas.  vermillion puts you into two different studio environments with lovely relaxing sound effects which you can toggle on and off.  favorite features include a web browser to follow along with yt tutorials and the overlay feature where you can grab an image and paint over it like tracing paper.  a wide variety of brushes are available, the dev has an eye for simplicity and efficiency.

what would turn a great app into a phenomenal one?  layers--the app includes 4 layers to work with, would be wonderful to include even more to create photoshop-like effects.  community art gallery--it would be nice to have a place to submit artwork as a shared community, a museum you could literally walk through.  more tutorials--thankfully i'm finding yt videos on some techniques  (straight line guide feature for example) but would love to see a lot more.   wacom--would love the ability to use drawing tablets.  my guess is it's not possible with the different platforms but wacom or similar would really open this app up.  more brush control--need a feature to produce lines of consistent smoothness and width.  vermillion is so good that lines will have rough ""splotchy"" paint edge lines like the real thing.  lastly i know you can dilute paint with the thinner but a paint feature to create soft drippy watercolors would be incredible.  as it stands the app is still phenomenal and absolutely worthy of a download--very highly recommended!",1653922800,5,"Thank you for your review and your suggestions!

"not many boxing games to choose from out there but just because i swing my arms like a windmill and sweat doesn't make this a good game. first the boxers are way to close to you, making you move completely out of your safe zone. even with a full room to play in a person still needs to be able to find a way back to the center. otherwise you will work your way into a wall or corner especially how you have to throw wirlwind punches from all directions. and may i remind the devs that when inside a headset with headphones you don't have a sense of the room. yes i know its vr but its also a game and if you use the virtual aspect against me then i will say the graphics and physics need a huge boost. this game is basically a bad attempt at making a quick dollar off the growing vr community. since most of us are new at vr we get sucked into buying these titles and thinking that we got an awesome experience out of it. even in the virtual realm of the game there is nothing that can give you a sense of where your at. for instance the coach is way out of reach, if you try to walk up to him you will hit a wall in reality, your gloves go through the turnbuckles and the ropes, to start the fight you either step back and lean forward to touch the mouthpiece or once the fight begins your opponent is actually blending into your gloves because he is so close, you can't block punches or knock the other guys hands away, you can't grab or hug an opponent which means no ref breaking you up and restarting the match, no coaching, no ring girls or round cards, no bright lights, no flashing cameras, you can barely tell if you connect with a punch because the graphics and physics are so bad, no intros or music, no customizing your gloves or shorts and i could go on and on if you want to say that this is a game... as far as a workout there is no metering or real punch stats that could qualify this as a excercising platform. all in all if you want to excercise then get box vr.",1536377014,5,"Thanks for your honest review.

I'd love to help you enjoy the game more if I can, and I'm always happy to chat with players and make changes based on their experience. This game certainly isn't a quick cash grab - it has been out for two years, has hundreds of positive reviews (>90%) across both stores its sold on, and has many players with dozens of hours of play time.

I have priced the game with this in mind, knowing I won't be able to provide the polish and content that bigger and better funded teams can.
--
The Thrill of the Fight was created to be a room scale boxing game where your play area acted as a miniature boxing ring that you are expected to move freely around in. I try to be very upfront about that and list it in the store description along with a minimum play area size, and I repeat it in the in-game text. The red rectangle you see on the floor in-game should be fully contained within the free space you traced out for Guardian and represents the area all of the in-game action will take place in. If it doesn't appear to be accurate then you may need to re-trace your Guardian bounds due to sensor movement. The red arrow on the floor marks the center point of that space and points in your forward direction. The coach is outside of your play area only if there's not room to squeeze him inside the play area with you. With larger play spaces, he is moved inside of your play area. You are expected to step back and reach forward to start the match while standing in your corner. Your opponent is placed immediately within your play space (and stays within it during the action) so that you don't swing outside of your safe area. If you stand in the middle of your space and reach behind you to start the match, you are placing yourself too close to the opponent when the round starts.
--
You absolutely can block punches, but the opponent intentionally tries to look for openings in and around your guard. You can hug an opponent to tie them up until the ref separates you, but that only happens if there is room for you to separate (so if you've cornered the opponent, you need to be the one to step backward).
--
You also absolutely do not have to throw wild, whirlwind punches. You can make them work, but it's more effective and far more enjoyable to throw good form boxing punches. If you crank up the difficulty and round count, you'll likely fall behind and wear yourself out trying to throw wild punches the whole time. TotF is basically a sparring or shadow-boxing simulator where you get out what you put in. I agree that the game fails to coach players, but I and the game's community are eager to help.

"this is currently the only mmorpg available for vr, and thankfully it's pretty darn good. the three most important parts of an mmorpg in my opinion are combat, community, and content (the three c's of mmorpgs!).

combat: some of the best for vr in my opinion. warriors swing a sword and have a shield, combos based on directional swinging. archers work like normal. musketeers have a gun they can load special ammo into the front of. runemages use gesture based casting for over 10 spells using their wand (more like drawing). with 3 sensors i have had no issues in combat.

community: literally the best community out of any game ever. you can go up to just about anyone and ask for help and they'll help you. if you ask a random person where something is, there's a 50% chance they'll give you directions, and a 50% chance they'll lead you there themselves. i haven't met a single rude person on here.

content: the bane of many vr games is that they're good, but they're short. the bane of many mmorpgs is that there's more grinding that actually playing the game. a vr mmorpg has a lot of potential to be very bad, but thankfully, the devs understand what consumers want. the world is huge. just walking without a mount, it'd probably take a good 15-20 minutes to get from one end to the other. there are a lot of unique enemies with different move-sets. there a ton of dungeons, and there are even world bosses. grind is present, but it's not overwhelming at all. you can almost max out a class just doing the main story line. there are a ton of sidequests as well.

finally, the #1 best part about this game, is the devs. they communicate a lot, ask what we want, listen to feedback, and constantly improve the game. you know what the devs are doing with the money they earned from early access purchases? completely overhauling the game. straight up remaking it to be completely better in every aspect. better mechanics, graphics, customization, more classes, more content, everything.",1546140214,5, ,331671

"i love epic roller coasters. after riding the two free when i first downloaded it, i paid for the other six coasters that were available at the time. there are racing and shooting modes for all coasters, you can ride with one of their companions (i wish they weren't all scary...lol) and, for those with nausea issues, you can wear a virtual helmet that takes away some of the 3d effect.
the reason i give this program five stars is that they are upgrading often. they first added a ninth roller coaster on the fantasy scale and then added a realistic section with one free. i immediately bought that package as well because there were five others already done with three more to be added. the way the home screen is set up, it looks like it is arranged so that they can add one more category. but since i bought the first package, they've added chains to the roller coasters so you hear and see those when going up a steep hill, they've added birds, characters, changed things and they do it often. it was worth every penny.

most of the poor reviews come from owners of something other than the oculus go. that is what i have and i have come up with a unique way to use this program. i have a stationary bike in my apartment. once i'm on the bike, i strap on the go and ride the roller coasters on my bike, leaning into the turns, speeding up when going downhill, etc. i also bought the whole package for my friend who also has a go and it was on sale so while i paid $20.00 for the whole thing...$10.00 for each set of 9 coasters, my friend got all 18 coasters for $10.00. 

there are no other roller coaster programs out there that give you 18 different coasters and, yes, there is an occasional glitch, but rarely and the quit button still works. maybe this isn't as compatible with the rift or other vr goggles, but with the go, it's fantastic.  you have to pay attention, like they change lighting or add signs, or where there was a witch, now there is a ghost. it is the best you can buy.",1588303414,5, ,39529

"story is incredibly short and half-baked at best, gameplay is clunky, animations are broken, its the same enemy over and over save for a few wearing some armor, weapon variety is artificial. nowhere near $30 in value. pick it up if it's on sale for like $10 maybe

overall 5/10 very middling experience. not much done well, plenty done poorly. campaign took about 2.5 hours before it was finally over.

guns: 4/10 functional but clunky and not fleshed out
enemies: 3/10 they designed one and slapped on some armor. enemies occasionally slide around or wiggle/vibrate when pathing gets confused.
level design: 5/10 painfully linear. underground sections had good lighting. why can't i drop a lit glowstick/flashlight though? 
character: 2/10 clearly attempts at comedy but all fell flat. mostly just wished he would shut up.
co-op: 3/10 feels like an afterthought. many sections do not lend well to multiple players, and the non-host players cannot interact with story items. minigun and sniping sections are basically one man shows while other players wait around. tethering prevents players splitting off to explore what little there is to explore. (not giving free points here for fun from playing with friends despite drawbacks)

"superhotvr, the re-review.

this game has changed, a lot, for the better.
a lot of bugs have been fixed, melee weapons no longer clip like you're attacking slimer from ghost busters and throwing items go where they're supposed to most of the time. not to mention bullets also seem a little easier to aim too, and the hitboxes have been tightened nicely from what i played earlier today, making it feel more like robo recall in a way, which i like, being as it stands robo recall is the one of the best vr shooters for oculus.

i also noticed much less stuttering and technical issues, which is good seeing as the game doesnt feature the technicalities of other games that run spectacularly (though, optimisation doesnt always need to be perfect, but it isnt good when a superhot game runs worse than something as like robo recall, dead n buried, even killing floor incursion, which are all more graphically spectacular by far).

you may notice i keep referencing roborecall, and thats because i would say after the updates superhotvr feels like it has almost nailed the well balanced mechanical feel robo recall has, which i like, although there are still glitches from time to time (especially with melee weapons and throwing items), i have to say its better.

overall, if its on sale for $10 or less, buy it! or if you're a fan of superhot and also like vr, i'd say its worth full price (i personally got it on the winter sale, when i bought a bunch of other games)

this review is valid as of 07/02/2019, with play time earlier today and yesterday (from a friend's account)

old review
((i am legitimately sad i cannot reccomend this game.
i love superhot & superhot: mind control delete.
i do not like superhot: vr.

why?
- the hitboxes for the player are miiiiiles too big, if my head was steve from minecraft, i would be harder to hit.
- weapons are glitchy as fuck. i constantly lose weapons to glitches.
- stutter. lots and lots of stutter. i think this might be because my oculus rift's main program was also open while steam vr was, but its just unacceptable how much this game stutters on my system, even when more demanding (and graphically amazing) games like robo recall run just fine))

"we all want a long and healthy life, although drinking clear water and breathing oxygen seems easy, 
to live a long healthy life there is much more to it and it is very important to be aware of as much knowledge as possible related to maintaining our body.

self-study is not always reliable as the internet is full of facts and ideas from self-appointed advising individuals. 
this makes it difficult to find correct information with as much certainty as possible. 
often this can be dangerous when people think they know what they are talking about, one specialist contradicts another, one homeopath contradicts another vegan, and so on. 
fortunately, there are medical services and encyclopedia that provide us with the necessary treatments and knowledge.

sharecare you vr is the vr version of sharecare you, the non vr version, a very handy digital encyclopedia that visually guides us through our body and organs, our neurological & blood systems and much more. find out how things work, where they are, how it connects to the rest of your body and this time via virtual reality technology.
via vr you can view things on a clearer level. 
sharecare you vr also provides a lot of usefull details related with what you are looking at, you will also be able to take a look at all the organs and how they work & move via sharp animated effects. 
you will also have the choice of some organs to view an unhealthy model of the organ so you can also observe the changes and damage.

"this is my absolute favorite game on the quest. i love what harmonix did with this game. i have been super obsessed with the dance central games (minus spotlight, never had it and don't intend to get it) and honestly this game has impressed me. it is gorgeous and has a lot of character, something i have expected from harmonix since they always pour sooooo much love and care into the dance central series. the choreography is centered mostly in your hands and you are scored on your movement pattern and hand/head position (to explain it veryyyy loosely)

important: as someone who was nervous that this game would be butchered, i loved it so much and i really hope to see sequel(s) to the series on this platform in a similar fashion.

loved: everything about the game lol, but to be specific - the new artstyle, the phone gimmick, the colorful club atmosphere, the act of befriending the dancers/giving them more personality (emilia is my favorite btw, always has been and always will!!) they made the dancers soooo much more expressive in this game while dancing, which i love!!! they have always made them pretty expressive (except spotlight) but they set the bar even higher in this installment. absolutely gorgeous.

changes i'd like to see in future installments: a little bit more variety in the choreography, sometimes (not always!) it feels like even in pro mode you do the same move for a long time. i'd also love to see full body tracking but that's not exactly harmonix's call haha. i would love to see more playable characters, more outfits/customization options in general for your avatar, more texts and things from the dancers long after you complete their stories (maybe something even as simple as a ""how are you?"" every now and then, for a loose example) i'd loveee to see a bigger tracklist next time and/or more dlc: i know there are limits and reasons why maybe this isn't possible, but this is just what i'd like to see. maybe even more outfits for the dancers?? or an option to choose their outfit (ex: texting them to wear a certain outfit, idk) random, but i love what harmonix did with dc3 by giving it a little story mode. even though it was goofy and borderline cringy in a good way, i loved that little touch and would love to see a more structured story mode of sorts in the future. i would like to see more assistance in the break it down/studio mode. it is a bit harder to see what you are doing wrong without the video record options, voice control, etc. an issue i have with dcvr is that sometimes the hands are a little laggy - usually when the hands are close to the head, a few weird visual things going on but i can't complain much. this is blazing a new frontier.

i'm sure i'm forgetting a lot of things i wanted to suggest or praise, but overall i am so happy with this game and i think i will be playing it for years and years. (i play the older dance central games to this day just for fun and exercise; had dc1/2/3 for closer to a decade now and they still have their charm) 

thank you so, so much, harmonix, for making this title and this series!!!!! would looooove to see a sequel on the quest ?",1593833014,5, ,197729

"[h1]experienced on the oculus rift with touch controllers[/h1]
[i]note: received game free as part of the steam curator connect program[/i]

this is another solid escape room from these devs who later made a similar game in escapevr: trapped above the clouds. they definitely know how to make escape rooms with sound logic. you don't have to be a puzzle pro or versed in obtuse puzzle mechanics to get past these puzzles. you simply have to be observant and use some common sense.

the problem is the price. much like, trapped above the clouds, the basement is overpriced given the quality & quantity of the content. i finished the game in 45 minutes. the basement is the earlier work and it shows. it's just a notch below the quality of above the clouds. 

there's basically three small puzzle rooms. there's even a hint system that i did not have to use. there's lots objects you can grab and some that you can interact with. several of the objects are not helpful in getting out. it's up to you to decide what is and isn't useful. movement is by teleportation and there is no turning (other than irl). you will have to crouch down for certain things, so a room-scale setup is advised.

i had fun. it's better than your average vr escape room. however, unlike other escape rooms in this price range it has less content / lesser graphics and/or cinematics / voice-acting / aaa production values to justify the price. and it's not as good as escapevr: trabbed above the clouds.  i think the normal price for this should be $5 given what's there. 

[b]rate 6/10. i definitely say buy it on a deep sale. if you can get it in a bundle this is a good one to spend 30-60 minutes in.[/b]",1545899427,3,0,564685

for anyone else just ask yourself if a game where the combat is a mix of dice outcomes and hearthstone sounds fun. if so then you¡¯ll love this game.

now as much as i love it there are two things i¡¯m annoyed with:
1. there is no way to save midway through a session. in single player it can be very frustrating to lose the experience you would have gained just because you have to run out or because the battery is about to die. a save or quicksave feature would be amazing.
2. i get how the single player is meant to be a practice for the multiplayer games, but it¡¯s really annoying to be stuck playing with two random characters for which you can¡¯t buy any cards. we really should be able to at least pick all three characters in single player.

if these two points could be improved it¡¯d be the perfect experience.

edit: with the latest update we can now select our whole team in singleplayer and customize their hands as well. just waiting on a save/quick save for this to be a perfect game now!

"it's really enjoyable once you figure out how to use the bullet time mechanic. while my first impression was that this game is not for me, i still wanted to give it a couple tries before uninstalling. gameplay became infinitely better after figuring out how to slow time mid-jump. then, how to effectively slide and thinking more about how to use the 3d virtual space (really helps if you also understand your 3d meatspace since you need to be physically active, slashing any direction, literally on your knees to slide, and so forth). switching to campaign mode helped me with all this. but never found much use of the wall jump/run mechanic.

"i am honestly sadden to make this but here we are.

first of all, i am a fan of the previous game and i have the say right off the rip i was extremely excited! i was a little surprised they were making a sequel for this game because i thought the first game was actually good! they could have just updated it and added co-op but i digress. however, when i finally convinced myself to buy this game and try it, oh boy... i was not happy!

upon booting it up, i went ahead and launched a new game and was in doing the options, no problem. however, when i got in, i experienced some really bad performance issues! i couldn't move smoothly like i normally did in other vr games and it was starting to make me sick (i want to state i have the meta quest 2 headseat). i had to literally research why the performance was so awful for my computer to find out the actual graphics settings were in the appdata folder... first red flag there! i had to dig into my pc and actually make anti-aliasing completely 0 as i was suggested and that's when i finally felt the game actually being smooth.

so, going through the game, i kinda felt a little underwhelmed with the intro. for some reason i felt more engaged in the first game's intro areas. that's just an opinion though. however, that's not really an issue. the second issue i was having was the character movement and what not. now i don't know if i set up my movement correctly which resulted in this but i do not like the arms attached to body mess. i'm 5'5 and i constantly had my head go into my chest and my arms would contort into weird angles and make the gameplay rather awkward. my quest setting were perfectly fine mind you. i tried to keep going like this but i stopped when i came across second enemy blob thing. now mind you, in the first game, these things were easy to dispatch but when i fought this thing i couldn't fight this thing to save my life. i aim, shoot, my rounds weren't hitting? my arms were contorting a bit which may have impacted my combat and that's where i died...

i knew this wasn't really for me so i went ahead and closed out and immediately requested a refund.

i don't think this game is at all garbage or bad! i think this game needs some serious work. the selling point this game is doing currently is the co-op feature but that's not really my thing! i enjoyed playing it alone and diving myself into the depths of this game. honestly, i didn't want to refund the game but for $40??? i felt this game wasn't worth $40. yes, i know it's in ea but this game is simply not ready yet in my opinion.

tl;dr - wait it out. this game is not ready to be played yet. it has major performance issues and the controls are janky. i highly recommend the first game over this as of right now. i may retouch on this game when it improves.

update after developer response:

first off, i want to say thank you very much for responding to this review! it shows how much you guys truly feel about our feedback.

i wanted to address the appdata location where i made the adjustments to my setting as found in the discussions part of the steam community area from a hardware discussion.

c:\users\*username*\appdata\local\intotheradius2\saved\config\windows\gameusersettings

while what you said is another location to edit options, that is where i found out how to completely turn off taa. again, i really appreciate you for sharing that with the team.

regarding height calibration, i?¡¥ve had it adjusted accordingly with my vr but i see this is a wip feature which is understandable.

as for the price, i truthfully respect what you say as this is your product. i was simply saying as an ea game i personally don?¡¥t feel $40 is the right amount, especially at its current state but i respect your team?¡¥s decision to make it that price as you all deserve a good income from this.

i sincerely hope i will come back and change my review however, i enjoyed the first game a lot and i?¡¥d love to see this game be much better! thank you for giving me an actual response and not a bot generated one!",1722576887,0,,171269607

1) enemies need to move their shield to block your attacks a bit more. (right now they just let you stab underneath until they die)
2) the hit boxes for the lower torso and legs needs to be adjusted. (seems like half of the time my sword just goes through the character model)

"i have mixed feelings. you must know, that i am a big fan of cl1. i bought cl1 on oculus go & pc and my expectations were big for cl2...
cl2 was released and i bought it on the quest & pc.
first shock, the gfx on my $1200 rtx2080ti+index looks exactly the same on my quests snapdragon 835 smartphone soc, more or less.
the trees are looking awful. in cl1 the trees are full with leaves. much more details and better textures in cl1.
textures on stones are not present, it looks very flat and loveless.
in a level with the sky in the background i couldnt believe what the deleopers and creators presented to me.
it looks like a total accident. the sky is only a flat, low resolution 360 degree picture, with ultra bad iso, and chromativ abberations....
byside every star, you can see big red, green, blue blobs. i preffer a renderered sky, or a high resolution high iso picture. it must not be a real photo, it could be computer generized picture. i think google picture search helps....
topic sky,... the clouds in cloudlands are not as good as the name cloudlands promise.
i will stop now, before i start to cry and lets move to the pros and cons. 


pro: 
- more elements in the level editor store
- 2 modes (golf/mini golf)
- natural wind, and wind from blowers
- editor on the quest avalable 
- cloudlands 1 & 2 levels playble in multiplayer when both player playing cl2 app
  (not possible to play against oculus go players live)
- a lot of userlevels from cl1 + cl2. (some from me... :-) )
- nice feature to follow the ball, after hitting the ball. (frequently press the front trigger)
- tons of level elements with funny functions
- theoreticaly unlimited new level designs, from online users created.
- a lot of freedom in the level editor, with the option to do freehand connecting parts (magnet off function)


con:
- bad textures, partwise bad sky wallpaper
- bad trees, worse then in cl1
- it looks that this app was developed specially for the quest and then it was quick and dirty compiled for the pc.
- no extra polish, no music volume slider for pc (only on/off) that sucks. i would like to share in the one or the other way same sound with my friends, also on the quest. on pc, there are some ways to do this with other programs in the background.
- not possible to play cl1 friends/opponets with oculus go
- missing an option slider to fade translucient for this annoying and ugly matrix lines byside some holes. 
- the new level editor is grafically a downgrade. in cl1 the pickup table for parts was so pretty, and now?
- sometimes my opponents putter is too far away from his body. looks wired, some times. it seems he has got extra long arms to reach the putter. 
- no free movement on the second controller stick. i know that the game is optimized to work with 2 hands and one controller. sometimes, in sitting position, its a pain to bring you exactly in front of the ball, and to place the putter exaclty how e like it.
- floor height was wrong on wmr + quest. on quest i could fix it in the oculus options/floor height adjustment settings.(in the oculus settings menu). the oculusbuttonlongpress recalibration did not work.


wishes:
- addon pack with higher quality and more 3d polished/shaded textures.
- in editor: (volumetric) colored light souces, like candles, fire sticks, to place in the cave levels, for more immersion and better looking lights on the wall textures. 
- addon better trees, more glas elements in the creators store, like in cl1 the first 10 levels.
- addon option to insert a (to my friends automaticly shared) streamlink and/or youtube for web radio in the game. after a couple of hours, the same sounds....
- level filter buttons or drop down menu for easier finding only minigof games. for ex.: golf/minigolf/mixed
- needs option/button to fix floor height. the menu i found, does not the job.
- and in this ""height"" menu i miss ""cm"" centimeter. we in europe dont know what 7""01`is...

conclusion:
its okay, but grafically not exactly as good as version cl1. it has got more elements, thats great, but the grafix over all did not impress my at all.
hopefully the developers are polishing some things. but let me say, the game fun is not all about the gfx. the physics is very good and 
its allways fun to play against the scoreboard or better play online with your friends. you can spend hours and hours in this game and
you will forget the time. the sozial aspect is a bid deal in vr and this game is great to hang out with your friends.

to the devs: please polish it on pc to cl1 standart or better :-)

dear gamer: dont forget, when you read my review, some time is gone and maybe... some things could be fixed/optimized.

"i rarely play any vr game for more than about 8 hours and i've got 36 hrs in as of the time of writing this.  so that's a check in the plus column.

the game is small, like if you only want to run it start to finish and move on it's like a 2 hour experience.  the thing you grind in this game are weapon mods to make your guns better so you can complete higher difficulties to unlock better mods to complete higher difficulties etc.  and to a lesser extent if you want to unlock weapon skins those are there too tied to different challenges for each gun (there's 6 guns).

rng in this game sucks though there's no mitigation towards fair drops by making the weight of non-duplicate items more than duplicates.  i will say with how difficult it is to complete at higher difficulties it's very anti-motivational to get duplicate equipment for your effort.  

what keeps me going?  the rush.  it an be very exhilarating at master and nightmare, when the 'zombies' keep spawning wave after wave after wave and your ammo's running dry and starting to panic lol.   or a brute spawns unexpectedly in a narrow hallway tears through your 3 team mates and it's up to you to kill it or it's game over.  despite everything else, this game is exciting.

it does have bugs to be worked out though let's not sugar coat things.  it needs some work . and index controller users have weapon carrying problems right now, others can bring 3 or 4 guns onto the field you're limited to 2 if you don't want one getting lost or you can bring 3 if you don't mind the risk of losing it b/c it'll constantly be falling on the floor.

graphically it's acceptable.  there are areas that look good but then there's other areas that i guess they don't expect you to look there like the overhead cables are very squarish.  

overall, fun game.  pretty hard to solo it on the hardest difficulties unless you've got sufficient mods and money (harvest) for bombs.",1640125251,3,0,700111

"had issue with launching carnival vr with alienware laptop and htc vive.  problem was game rendering on laptop screen but, not in the htc vive headset.  all i could hear was audio. contacted 2k support and after going back and forth with system logs they narrowed down issue to nvidia control panel setting to force nvidia card to run when the gamer is launched.  its only vr game i have to force this setting but, the fix resolved my issue.  

2k support was very helpful and went above and beyond to resolve issue for me.  the game itself is alot of fun.  probably best carnival style game out there for vr, next to nvidia vr funhouse.   the physics is pretty spot on in each of the mini games. so, it feels right whenever you are playing skeeball, etc.",1496815643,2,0,480672
"i bought the oculus dk2 just for ***** & giggles. i knew though that with time, more research and a little imagination that vr could only improve. as soon as i put on the dk2 and found myself in a black room of endless nothingness standing in front of a low res office desk i knew that vr held the future of gaming... heck, the whole entertainment industry can and will benefit from vr. being able to stand in that empty black space and look at that desk just as i would look at the desk my gaming rig sets on simply blew my mind. the possibilities that ran through my mind at that very moment were endless and if these thoughts were going through my mind they surely were going through the minds of gaming developers... weren't they? now that semi-practical vr (it's still expensive) is finally here and i've got the real deal, i'm waiting for all of those ""possibilities"" to become a reality. it seems that i am going to be waiting for a long time unfortunately. because of the price point, many gamers can't afford to hit the vr scene, which leaves many devs scared to spend the kind of cash that is needed to make a aaa blockbuster vr game. this unfortunately leaves all of us having to sift through a lot of crap just to simply find a vr game with half of the sparkle that a aaa game has. every now and then though you do find diamond in the rough, but even those games are good, they tend to be really short with little or no replay value. roborecall is really good. the graphics are on point and the audio backs it up. the ability to kill robots in various different ways is a huge plus and keeps the game fresh. the only thing that kills it for me is the lackluster plot mixed with (imo) a little to much 90's rail shooter flair. the plot is a huge deal for me and if the storyline were there i would definately rate it at 5 stars!",1502594614,5, ,314460

1. the climbing onto a ledge is a bit weird, and never explained well. you have to grab on to the ledge, crouch down and pull yourself up.

2. there is no saving in the middle of a level, and the levels are pretty long. the developers said that will be fixed sometime in january. edit: they fixed this one :)

3. motion sickness. i didn't experience this problem myself, but everyone else that tried it did. there are no comfort options

"when you look at half life alyx from eyes outside of vr, just as a video game, i think it's a solid game. the mechanics are simple, but well polished, it looks great, it's well paced, and decent lengthed, coming in around 11-12 hours.

however, when you compare its level of visual fidelity and polish to other games in the world of vr, there's such an astronomical jump from the closest comparison that it's hard to not give a glowing review of this game on that front alone. this is one of the only truly aaa titles i've experienced in vr and it makes me excited for what vr's future could hold, so long as strong developers with proper investment are willing to take a chance on it.

the only major negative i walked away with involved movement. in vr, in a game filled to the brim with immersive moments, forcing players to platform or use movement options that teleport them breaks that immersion (at least in my case.) every time i had to jump or hold forward to crawl through a hole, i found myself sighing and wishing some different solution was chosen. as an intro to vr, i understand that forcing a player's visuals to move against their head can be disorienting, but i'd much rather have that forced movement on a personal level.

i haven't dove into the mod scene yet, but i look forward to it. the core game has all the right guts to make for a great survival horror game, and i'm sure the community has latched onto that.",1609394951,3,0,534104

"i'd had my eye on airtone for a long time, but had been dubious at only 25 songs and no sign of an update. as a rhythm game fan, the visuals and song style of the game really drew me in, which few vive games do. so i brought it in the sale, and... i want to be happy with it? but there's a few factors that really make me side-eye it.

- songs:  amazing, but far too short, and far too few. -
the songs themselves are fantastic, reminiscent of games like 'child of eden' or the upbeat eastern songs of 'dance dance revolution'.  a big put-off is that unfortunately they're very short. it leaves you at the end of each level going '... is that it?', which... if it had more than 25 songs this might be okay, but i've been playing the game properly for around 15 minutes and i'm already through 4 of them. i didn't expect this to have as much replayability as 'choose your own song' vr rhythm games, but the replayability of 25 short songs (even on 3 different difficulties) seems far too little. all in all, i never feel satisfied at the end of the songs, and that's really important for a rhythm game.

- visuals: perfection. -
the visuals didn't let me down one bit- in fact i was more upset that i didn't have more time to inspect the worlds around me whilst i was flying over the planet. they're simple, colourful, and out-of-this-world, which i appreciate so much in a vr game. i kind of hoped the 'look at the world' item in the hub would let you stare at the locations like a vr gallery, but no such luck.
i literally cannot fault the visuals at all.

- neon: we need to talk about her english va -
i'd heard in reviews that switching neon to her japenese va was prefereble, but i figured that was just anti-dub anime fans or something. but no, i found myself instantly hating her and her voice, skipping everything in the forced tutorial so i could change her to japanese as soon as possible. it may sound harsh, but honestly her english va is stiff, unemotional, constantly sounds like she has a cold, and i don't think any line from her sounded natural. i get that neon's an android, but her japanese voice is fluent and welcoming (enough to redeem herself as a liked character after the english va puts you off). there are hundreds of female voice actors out there (myself included) that could bring her to life, and mimic her japanese personality, but it was settled on something so far away that the difference is mind-boggling. she's the only voice in your game, so it seems like it should be important to have the va up to scratch to meet the standards of the rest of this fantastic game.

neon's design however is rather adorable, bright, and she makes for a fantastic host. i've only seen a small amount of her story, but i can't wait to find more if i do continue to play.

- the lobby: it's fun, but a bit janky -
i've not much in the lobby in the way of toys, but what i have unlocked has been fun. the only issue i have is the posistion of some of the toys ( especially the grafitti toy ) attach to your hand in the most awkward fashion. this makes them very hard to use. the items that provide back-story were a great unexpected edition to the game though.

- to summarise -
songs are too short, and too few., and the english va isn't at the same level as the rest of the game.
but if you want a brilliant, unique, beautifully visual rhythm game for the vive? get this.
perhaps get this only during the sale though, as with such short songs, it doesn't feel like a full game.",1509215030,3,0,669250

"i can already tell this game is short because of the puny lil list of achievements. i'd prefer to use the xbox controller but there is no easy option to switch in the game and it does not automatically recognize it. they intend for you to use motion controls, yet they're horrible. hope you want to dash and teleport because there's no simple way to move about. this really sucks in a fast-paced game like this or serious sam because it means the action is dumbed down to make clumsy controls accommodating (simply moving and turning with the sticks is a necessary option for these games!). i like the game but there needs to be better movement options and automatic recognition for handheld controllers. if you're a fan of doom and vr though, it's a must.

i really dont know why there is better performance, possible the developers did more optimization since steam release was later than oculus home.

good quality inside my oculus rift cv1, i bought the tables in oculus home and send zen support a e-mail with my recipe and got the keys for steam also.

its worth the money, even for people who already bought the 2d tables... if you own a htc/oculus dont miss that fun.

"gameplay is a mixture of the original rainbow six and ghost recon. just the lobby is like an old-school rainbow six kill house map. very large open maps, like ghost recon - only difference is that didn't have rock climbing and this does. but it also has small rainbow six style maps as well with hostage rescue and such.

rock climbing sniper pvp tactical action is unlike anything i've played before. larping with a metal gear solid 2 seal team 6 load out is fun. the discord is always extremely active if you want a slightly older crowd to play more seriously with - however pvp is good even with the squeekers.

phobia warning spoiler: coulrophobia - this game has clowns.

the start and end of the game are rough, being mostly jump scares out of nowhere. the middle of the game can be tense, but not scary.

the most prominent enemy you fight is cute, which kills some otherwise tense scenes. combat is generally wiggling a wrench or firing an auto-aim bolt from your fist in later levels.

the few characters and story are well done, they're believable, and i got attached to them; the best game aspect.

"[h1]overview --[/h1]
pistol whip is a vr on-rails rhythm shooter. pick a track and you'll find yourself steadily progressing in a straight line through a neon pulsing environment. enemies will both be waiting for you and spawn as you approach, occasionally right in your face. your objective is to dispatch every enemy on tempo. your score is split between how accurate your shot is and how close you match the tempo. the developers update this game every couple months with new content, the newest as of writing this is the 2089 campaign.

now that we have that out of the way let's get to the good and bad.

[h1]good --[/h1]
[list]
[*]dodging bullets and obstacles is intuitive, fair, and is excellent at getting you moving. if you happen to miss an enemy you can keep going, as attacks only come from either the front or to the sides, never from behind.
[*]the sort of ""retro"" polygonal design to the environment and the enemies is a great style choice. blood, eviscerated flesh, and extreme realism is cool, but it's not always necessary. an environment pulsing to the beat and an explosion of polygons can be quite satisfying
[*]some of the levels have nice environmental things to experience, themed to go with the song. it's really well done. the first time you see a [spoiler]dancing enemy[/spoiler] is quite a fun treat. equally so later on when you see one [spoiler]flying over your head[/spoiler], or a bunch of [spoiler]jeeps launching themselves all over the place[/spoiler]. it's surreal in the best way.
[*]the amount of built in customization is great. want to play with two guns? you got it. want to have a more relaxing time with enemies who won't fire back? done. put yourself to a real test and turn off the aim assist. these and more are all options you can toggle on or off anytime you want. you can even customize the look and sound of your gun!
[*]the developers provide free updates frequently. not just hotfixes, but all new content. right now i believe it's 10 base levels, 8 free update levels, and as of a couple days ago a brand new 5 level campaign. for something so quality that any other studio would be charging you $15 a pop for, this is outstanding. buy this game and show your support for these people. they deserve it.
[/list]
[h1]could be better --[/h1]
[list]
[*]lacking custom levels has been a big complaint i've seen levelled at this game. while it hasn't be implemented yet, i believe the developers have made a statement that they're looking to implement it as soon as they can. with the amount and quality of free content they've provided so far i'm not in any particular rush.
[*]music genre is another complaint i've seen come up. i agree that these types of songs aren't what i would normally listen to (some of them i do quite enjoy though), however they do match the theme of the game very well. i'm not sure metallica would make sense in a game like this.
[*]some people have cited replayability as a sore spot. all-in-all, with the current feature set as of writing this, you can run through each individual level and the campaign in under two hours on hard mode. if you're a one-and-done type of person maybe that's not enough for you. the ""short"" runtime doesn't bother me since you're meant to play again to get better scores, or use a different modifier, or just because you enjoy it. many people also can't do vr for long periods of time either, so the fact that this game isn't bloated like some churned out harmonix game isn't a negative for me. quality over quantity folks.
[/list]
[h1]overall -- 9/10[/h1]
let's be honest, there aren't that many quality vr games around yet. this is one of the few good ones and it's only a few bucks. compared to what you likely paid for your vr setup this is only pennies more. it would be my dream come true if these developers created a more typical on-rails shooter like virtual cop, house of the dead, or time crisis. here's hoping.",1607032204,0,0,377726

"[h1]the good:[/h1]
+ this is legitimate the highest level of detail i have seen yet in any vr game. environments are littered with small details and physics based objects, which react in a believable way. npcs have a great ammount of detail and good animations. the soundscape also is very nice.

+ all this runs surprisingly well on max settings on my i7-7700k + gtx 1070 on oculus rift.

+ i like how old gameplay mechanics, such as the health stations are implemented in a way which is interesting and makes sense. the puzzle minigames are interesting and fun, although sometimes at first not obvious in which way to solve. physics are implemented well, although the player is not fully physically implemented like in boneworks.

+ the 3d spaces in loading screens are a nice addition which keep immersion and help pass the time faster


[h1]the bad:[/h1]
- the gravity gloves aren't as intuitive as they could and should be. how hard you have to swing to pick up items felt hard to estimate and to then have to grab it felt weird, i would have prepared a laser pointer approach similar to h3vr.

- the gun interaction sadly seems pretty basic. i only played about an hour because of the refund window and loading times and therefore only played with the basic pistol, but the reloading firstly feels very wrong because you have to reach for a magazine over your shoulder, and secondly does not feel direct enough when you handle the gun. more gun focused games like h3vr have done a far better job.

- the combat sadly also is not very interesting, because you more or less just stand there and shoot the zombies a veery slow and do not react to where or how you shoot them.

- one of the biggest problems i have is the very slow movement speed.  i normally walk faster in real life than alyx in this game, which is unimmersive and holds you back.

- there simply aren't enough settings/options, some of which i would consider essential. there is no setting to change with which stick you move (which feels weird if one the wrong as a left handed person). ladders should be fully climbable, the delayed short teleport at the top is weird. crouching has to be able to be done with real movement, not teleportation which breaks immersion and disorients.


[h1]in short:[/h1]
overall half life alyx is a great looking game but sadly gameplay and movement now for me are not really enjoyable and definitely not worth 50. boneworks is worse in graphics but does physics simulation of the player better and has more interesting gameplay, especially gunplay and parkour. i cannot comment much on the story because of the 2 hour refund window.",1585007769,2,0,561301

"hey all,

after playing through the helgen portion, and exploring the wildlands a bit i've got a few things to say which may just be me, but this is my opinion.

combat :

very...awkward trying to stab someone twice with daggers, and my sensors find it to be ridiculous.
non-dom hand controls your walking, and for some reason it keeps veering me off on its own.

magic spells are hugely disappointing, so pretty in the normal game, very..2d in this. 
bow and arrows are horrible, many other games got it right, this clearly was rushed. 


the models are so ugly, and you can't turn the graphics up.

just over all a huge let down for me, i was expecting to go into the skyrim world which looks good on the normal game, and have a lot of fun, but it's a ton of bare interface, can't pick up and store stuff behind your back like an inventory, you just click a and it picks it up.. just not worth it imo.",1522713918,2,1,610097

"first of all, there are so many things to love about beatsaber. for starters, the game is incredibly immersive, thanks to its intuitive controls and stunning graphics. it truly feels like you're in the middle of a futuristic dance party, with neon lights flashing and music blasting all around you.

another big selling point is the game's incredible replay value. with so many songs to choose from and a variety of difficulty levels to master, you can easily sink hundreds of hours into the game without getting bored. and the feeling of improvement as you progress through the levels and songs is truly addictive.

one of the best things about beatsaber, though, is its ability to provide a workout in disguise. while you're having fun slashing away at virtual blocks, you're also getting a great cardio workout without even realizing it. it's a fantastic way to get some exercise while having fun.

as for dislikes, some players have found that the game can be a bit repetitive after a while, especially if you're only playing a few songs over and over again. others have noted that the scoring system can be a bit finicky at times, which can be frustrating when you feel like you're doing everything right.

overall, though, beatsaber is a highly recommended game for anyone who loves music, vr, and fun game play. whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the world of vr, this game is sure to provide hours of entertainment and exercise.

also thanks to the game's open-source nature, there are countless mods and custom songs available that can enhance your gameplay experience in countless ways.

for example, there are mods that can add new weapons or visual effects to the game, as well as mods that can adjust the difficulty settings or even create entirely new game modes. and with so many talented modders working on the game, new mods are being added all the time.

but perhaps the most popular aspect of modding in beatsaber is the ability to add custom songs to the game. with just a few clicks, you can download and install custom songs that range from popular hits to niche tracks that you might not have heard before. this essentially means that the game's library of playable tracks is virtually unlimited, providing even more replay value.

overall, the modding community for beatsaber is truly impressive, and it's one of the reasons why the game has maintained such a strong player base since its release. whether you're looking to add some new challenges to your game play or just want to experience your favorite songs in a whole new way, the modding capabilities of beatsaber are truly impressive.",1683633417,0,,138042759

"fantastic looking lil western shooter.  can play against other players (small playerbase at the moment but you can help that - yes you review reader!) or bots in order to increase the bounty on your head.  love the little touches with the wanted poster etc.  guns take a little getting used to due to the calibration - if you look down at the holster to figure out where your hands need to be then you're gonna miss grabbing them as the holster moves up naturally as you straighten your body - instead look dead on into the opponents eyes and feel for the vibration from the controllers when you put your hands down to the holster, thats how ya get the guns easier :)

the games roadmap promises so much more for the future so really looking forward to seeing how it evolves over time.  biggest problem at the moment is getting a multiplayer game - not because of a lack of other players but because theres no lobby system to meet other players outside of the duel, and sitting waiting for another player to duel you can be pointless as they might all be fighting ai bots instead of trying multiplayer mode.  if you've got a mate to duel with though its awesomesauce.  once the salloon gets opened up in an upcoming update hopefully we'll be able to actually see all the players online and participate in group activities before pairing off for duels :)",1488024392,3,0,522671

"this game runs and looks very good. was surprised at how fun this game actually is. there is some building in the game so i see why some people say its like a vr ""fortnite"" but kinda has an apex kinda feel to it. even has a mode where you can squad up with randoms or friends and all the other players on the map are bots. you can also buy coins in the game to unlock skins and characters if you choose to do so or level up and doing missions assigned to you at the time to obtain coins. solid 7.5 out of 10 in my opinion. 

prob would be a higher score but that's due to pistols kind of being over powered in the game. the way you aim/reload sniper rifles and the fact you can shoot your gun while gliding, but all of that is just mine and my friends opinion. sniper rifles(awp) are auto zoomed in when you two hand them and you have to use your support hand to use the bolt on the sniper to reload so it's kind of clunky. the pistol can pretty much laser someone across the map very fast with really good accuracy and hit pretty much the same amount of damage as the smg and some rifles.",1609704312,0,0,687411

this is going to be the 'urban strike' of vr game that i never knew i've always wanted, yet it's so much more.  the vtol flight physics are pretty darn interesting ...it took me a couple of tries to get any measure of finesse at vertical takeoff transition and landings - but i eventually managed to drop off the troops, rescue some crash survivors, deliver them to the hospital with bingo fuel, and rtb like a boss.

needless to say, pickup/dropoff missions, close air support, and all manner of missions could make this into a very dynamic game with varied things to do.  it's ea, so everything isn't there, yet.  my only real complaint so far is that the terrain leaves a lot to be desired, as well as transitions into cities.  (hopefully the map will get a lot of attention at some point).  however, for now, and for the price, the flight mechanics alone are probably worthwhile, though i kind of wish the aircraft systems had a touch more complexity (fuel lines, radio comms, etc.)

We have just tested the game the same way you describe it, but we cannot reproduce the issue. Would you tell us how do you replay the round? Do you do it by clicking on the PLAY AGAIN button or by returning to the main menu? If you return to the main menu, does the issue happen when replaying the same course or a different one?

Sometimes, issues occur because game data gets somehow corrupted and get fixed by uninstalling the game and installing it over, would you try it?

Please, reach us at users@aaagamestuidios.com. We will do our best to help you.

"did exactly what i expected and them some. it surpassed boneworks in every way. my only complaint is that it wasn't long enough! (30 hours of playtime later: its long enough for a fifth play through with self imposed challenges. it also needs modding so get used to rooting though mods folders. treat it like a vr garry's mod with a slightly more annoying mods system and a very replayable main story and it will serve you well.) after a few years and more time with vr i realized that this game, is ok. if buying it for the story is enough, buy it. otherwise take your money elsewhere. the modding and sandbox elements are lackluster at best and boring at worst. unfortunately this isn't on the part of the mod devs, just the game devs. they have been putting more time into being a engine dev and less into being a game dev. now this isn't bad if they only did what anton does with h3vr. but they don't for no logical reason. this game stands as a ok mediator between boneworks and the machine king which looks to be releasing somewhere between now and 2400. save your money till then, until that point play something better. #additional thoughts. the gun play feels like spitting bullets out a old cardboard tube compared to h3vr, all while sacrificing the interesting interactivity of gun mechanics for the purpose of making guns dumber than they already where. the breast physics are cool but don't effect physics much or anything else in the slightest 4/10. and the main gimmick of a fully interactive world that uses your in game body has been done to death by any modern vr title worth their salt so thats not worth anything though the body swap mechanics are cool when done properly. and the story while fun has no actual barring on the boneworks lore apart from world building with a premature wet fart of a ending that rips from classical painting at a vain attempt of being meta, i did still cry though so that's worth some points. and this goes out to all the game devs, stop making your game story like halflife! i want to stop just wandering from point to point not knowing whats going on unless i bring a detective friend over to find clues, its annoying. but hey now the feel is ten percent better. we just have to finish the story add full mod support and revive the decaying corpse of the community. it cant be that hard, right?",1688198293,0,,141032602

"i am reviewing this game with a valve index.

if you're an elder scrolls fan like me, i highly recommend getting this game and mod the game with vrik (which gives you a body), higgs (adds basically hla glove interaction in game and also fixes the havok physics bugs), spell wheel (let's you select spells in real time.), and ussep + its vr patch. they are essential mods in my opinion and turns the game into a great experience. most special edition mods like beyond skyrim bruma work with the game too so that's a great bonus.

the vr playspace for the main menu can break some mods, so i recommend putting bloadvrplayroom=0 in the ini file when you're using mo2. you may lose physical sneaking and jump, but there's a mod for that (auto sneak and jump vr) to add that back. another advice is to disable dynamic resolution to reduce the blurry.

anyways, i am having such a blast with this game. it has a very high replay value, and i could see myself easily playing this game for several years to come, similar flatscreen skyrim. i don't think i can return to regular skyrim and play as much as i am with this vr version. i can get so immersed in it.

""well in vr you clearly can't have turning or ripping and tearing, so we just removed all that.""

robo recall: am i a joke to you?
-

so first of,
-i played this game with the oculus. it's not on the list of compatible vr-headsets, but that is a trend of all bethesda-studios games and it plays just like any other compatible game.
-i barely played this game, because one very fatal flaw.

so compared to say skyrim vfr or fallout vfr, that have turning, movement options and a full game.
this one has none of it.

in the story you play as a regular soldier (not a big problem for me, but it can be disappointing).
and instead of execution animations, you just tele-frag enemies. (slightly disappointing this one, especially after played robo recall)

and you can't turn.... wait what!?
that's right, if you don't have a 360 setup, you're f'd at the first button you come across.
this game does not have increment or smooth turning like any vr game since forever.
so if they put something 180¡ã, that you can't activate from the back, like say, the first button of the game. you might as well play bad rats, 'cause at least you can get somewhere with that.",1562423265,0,0,674302

"great game. i never was into shooters or zombies, but the gameplay and graphics (oculus quest) pulled me in. i recently became fascinated with horde mode, in the canyon. my question is about the burgers. i know you can save burgers between the 5 wave ""break"" by holding on to them, and taking bites from them. but no matter what you do, the burgers will disappear. sometimes all at once, sometimes one or two at a time. one time three burgers disappeared, only to reappear on the ground between the two crates! developers - can you make it so the burgers don't disappear? it's discouraging to have an element of the game that is beyond our control, that if we are disciplined and able to save burgers for later on, we should be able to count on that effort later. the gameplay is good enough in horde mode that you can get pulled in to where eventually conserving ammunition is an issue (above wave 50), and at that point, not having your burger stash just feels punishing and a little too random and poorly thought out, compared to the rest of the game. if this was intentional, i'd say poor choice. if it's a bug, *please* fix it!!!!! otherwise, hats off to you guys, superb product.",1593919414,5, ,145301
"exa has three identities in my mind.

first, it is a really fun toy.  you can draw any shape you like and start smacking it to make sound.  exa makes it easy to combine these in ways to actually make music, without requiring any sort of music theory, or you can play around with the pre-set up instruments or even fully fledged songs that come with it.

second, it is a fun sandbox for user generated content.  the library of instruments, scenes, and songs is continuing to grow, and people are coming up with all kinds of fun and crazy ideas.

third, it is an actual music instrument.  as in, if you wanted to get serious, you could practice, get good at it, play music with your friends, or play live shows.  it has full daw integration so you can easily record using your favorite workstation.

"there are many reviews for many different games that say things like ??est game on the quest??etc. many of these recommendations are just plain subjective or they have not played enough games to accurately make that declaration. i have played about 80 games now and i can honestly say, if mini-golf or even regular golf appeals to you at all, this game is a must have. the putting mechanics are realistic and require good putting form to play well. the course designs are many, varied, and engaging. you get 16 courses plus there are 4 more dlc courses, it easily has the best value for your vr gaming dollar. on a first play through of a hole it may appear that there is only one way to approach it, but as you get more experience you will discover that many holes have multiple paths with their own risks and rewards. the lost balls and scavenger hunts are fun to do with friends. oh, and this is one of the only games to make playing with friends easy. just all decide on a room name and join it for a private match. for future sessions, just join the same room name, easy. you could even just play your solo games or practice sessions through this room and have friends join whenever. no random room numbers or clunky join private game mechanics. also recommend joining the devs discord server to discover a vibrant player community. daily challenges, guides, trick shots, and competitive league play. once you discover the player community, and play some matches with them, the depth and addiction to the game really increases. you will learn new strategies for each hole and even some trick shots. the league plays once per week with different tee times available. practice your shots and strategy during the week to be competitive on sunday. it really puts a new perspective on an already great game. ok enough talking it up, just buy it already.",1641478560,5, ,199052

"playing this game feels like learning to walk again. in the beginning you have no idea how things work, or what you should expect. the game gradually teaches you every vr mechanics with trial and error. and this continues during the whole story. i'm really amazed by how well this is designed throughout the game. there are some repetetive parts, but you are soon presented with new things to thinker with.

the atmosphere of this game is really amazing. i was constantly just stood and watched the environment as it breaths and lives. it's not uncommon to have horroristic elements, especially a very dear friend.. oh boy! :) the music and ambient sounds elevates these moments excellently.
it was a very unique moment to realize how big headcrabs are. :d also everything sizewise feel very realistic standing next to it.

there's not much face-to-face scenes with other humans in the game, which is somewhat disappointing. those little amount of f2f dialogs in alyx are priceless though. also russel - even though you mostly just hear him - is a very good commentary throught the game. love the jokes between him and alyx.

the ending ""bonus game"" part was just insane, loved it. the closing moments are definitely something what the fans were waiting for many years.

those who say this game could have been made without vr in mind don't know what they are talking about.
this game has many puzzles which simply cannot be translated to keyboard and mouse.

also it has a very different feel when it's you who has to crouch behind objects to avoid gun fire, and throw back granades before they blow up. learning how to throw stuff is very important in this game.
also learning how to reload your weapons quickly should become second nature very fast, otherwise enemies will rush your position.

this is how a vr game should look like. definitely something to remember.

"[h1]crisp, beautiful scenery mixed with real-time strategy mechanics.[/h1]

cosmic trip is crisp, beautiful scenery mixed with rts mechanics and the ability to zip back and forth between a small collection of defendable locations in a given scene.  while it was very playable in a small space, it did require a lot of roomscale movement to place the bot generators and enter teleport gateways.  it would have been nice to see the teleport mechanic redesigned for seated players, but there's a certain immersion to how it requires you to lean into the portals.

the game feels very polished.  it runs smoothly.  it has short loading times.  it sounds great.  it feels immersive.  it looks beautiful.  it provides a very low end friendly experience that won't bog down when tons of enemies flood the scene.  it also has a very well explained control scheme that mostly feels intuitive to someone like myself, who as played rts games countless times.

there are a lot of tiny features to this game which add some extra flavor to the experience.  for example, you can put swag on a drone: https://clips.twitch.tv/littleattractivepassionfruitripepperonis

there's a surprising amount of challenge in this game, too.  the enemies can easily overwhelm you in some game modes.  that said, you can play more relaxing game modes if you want to.

"recommended for vive.

if you have a vive and like guns, buy this freakin game. it's great.

if you have an oculus, the controls for the safety are on the same hand as holds the gun. not the other hand. just move the joystick to one of the four quadrants and click it, to test the different options. have fun!

this game has more realistic gun handling and better sound than bam.
i will update this review more once i have played it more, but it is clear a lot of work went into it.

update: for extra fun, and to make up for iron sights in vr being low-res, try the reflex sights. they can be mounted on some soviet weapons and some pistols by using an adaptor. many nato weapons support the reflex sights natively.

using clay pots as skeet is super fun. so is mounting two sniper scopes to a pistol, just because you can.

i'm buying a second copy soon to keep a promise to the developer. (also a third copy cause reasons)",1508617837,3,0,475104

"probably the most fun i've had with the vive.  however, if the game didn't keep score at all, people would be upset.  there's a much bigger flaw here that no one is talking about.  you can just hold both shields at your chest and get a perfect score.  the developer really needs to fix this.  only after, will it be almost perfect.",1467222217,0,0,448718
"locked in vr is an incredible and unique escape room with a style that makes it stand out among others of it's kind.

the game has you waking up in a run-down basement, full of garbage, junk, and your typical corpse hanging from the ceiling.  from there you receive a phone call saying you have a limited amount of time to find your way out.  you look at the wall in front of you with a timer that is slowly counting down from 1 hour.  now it's a race against the clock with your own life on the line. 

the atmosphere is top notch.  you truly feel like you're in the disgusting basement of a serial killer.  there's dim lighting, blood on the floor, that dead body hanging above you, etc.  you really do get a sense that a deranged murder has commiting all sorts of disgusting and horrible acts in there.  the one issue with the graphics is that they are fuzzy... as if you need glasses.  it does not look as sharp and clear as in the trailer.  even with supersampling enabled, it's not good and takes away from the otherwise impressive surroundings.

if you're looking for a challenge then you have one.  i was not able to get out of the room in time and met a horrible death.  but one thing that maybe made this happen was a certain part of the game is bugged.  
*possible spoilers ahead*  
in the game you have to find slides to place inside of a projector.  some of the slides are worthless while some of them provide valuable information to help you escape.  when i was playing there were three slides that just would not go in the projector, while all the rest of the slides went in with no problem.  it's quite frustrating when you're towards the very end and cannot progress any further because of a bug like this. i'm curious to know if anyone else came across this issue.
*end of spoilers*


i also had some minor issues when it came to grabbing things, which wasn't game breaking but was annoying every now and then.  and the other minor issue is the voice acting of your character; he sounds like a russian nathan from south park (google him if you want to know what i mean).  i hope there comes an option to disable the narration.

despite the fuzzy graphics, the projector bug, and the poor voice acting, the game is very much worth the $6.  i trust that the projector issus will be fixed if the dev ends up reading this review and hopefully something can be done about the fuzzy graphics.

tl;dr  locked in vr has a mentally disturbing and horrific atmosphere with engaging puzzles and is one of the best escape rooms for vr to date.",1480623813,2,0,577363

Thanks for the awesome review and we're extremely humbled you decided to go with Espire 1 as your first VR experience and it's even better to see you enjoyed the game. :) In regards to game length and replayability we have a main mission campaign which I'm sure you're already aware of that contains 6 missions however there are other aspects to the game that can add replayability for you and we can definitely advise on those. :) First of all you have the challenges mode. These present an array of different levels with various categories of challenge and aims such as hostage rescue, hacking workstations and collecting info on intel challenges, climbing challenges and many more. We definitely encourage to check those out as they add a lot to the game in themselves. We also have something called Espire trials which act as side missions. These can be found on the mission screens on the main campaign in the main menu. If you hover your controller over say for example the mission 1.1 screen towards the bottom left you'll see sole blank boxes with small illustrations. Hover your controller over those and it will outline the trials and how to achieve each one. Some of these can be relatively easy while some are challenging but at the same time rewarding as by completing each trial you'll unlock some of the in game cheats which you can then later use for some fun whenever you wish such as invisible Espire, tiny Espire, golden gun etc. :) There's also weapon procurement in each mission where again if you go to each mission screen you'll see some different weapons pictured. These are the weapons you can unlock in each mission and by finding and recovering them you can then use them next time you enter the level. Some guns are easily found whereas some are more concealed and you have to go on a bit of a treasure hunt exploring all the routes sometimes in the missions to find each one. There are also the leaderboards you can aim to improve yourself on and more to keep you occupied. :) We hope that helps for ideas with replayability. Thanks again for leaving us a great review and thanks for playing. :)",155443

Glad you enjoyed the game despite the sometimes suboptimal hand tracking tech.

It takes some time to get used to it and we tried to make it more visible by tinting the hands red when the cameras don't have ideal tracking of the hands.

The quality of hand tracking heavily depends on the conditions of your environment, here are some tricks to optimize it:
- Have good lighting in the room
- No direct sunlight or glares from windows
- Good contrast between the color of your hands and the background. Hope this helps!
- Keep both hands in the field of view and not obstructing one another
- Try to not move too fast in general

"10 is probably right on the upper limit of the price range for this game. it's a fun, well-made and nicely cartoonish vr shooter set in a western town. there's a decent amount of different weapons to mess around with, and shooting them feels good. 

however, the game is quite limited. as is the case with many shooting gallery games, after playing for half an hour you've pretty much seen most of what there is to see. also, the game doesn't do an amazing job of letting you know there are people behind you, or out of your field of view, shooting at you. it can get a bit frustrating unless you're constantly spinning around to look at your surroundings.

on the plus side, absolutely no nausea issues. this is probably largely because the game doesn't really require you to move around, and is in fact completely playable sitting down if you so choose. 

high noon vr was literally the first game i played with my rift s headset, and it was fun. other vr shooters i've played since do do more varied things and try to prolong the experience, but high noon vr is very polished, very comfortable to play, and quite a lot of fun, so it's well worth a look at 10, and definitely if you can pick it up from a sale.

[b] here's an abstract of part of it: [/b]
my main gripe was how repetitive the gameplay was. overall it¡¯s pretty mundane and visually primitive, certainly in regards to 2020 standards, even if the game did look as good as half-life: alyx¡­ ¡°sorry! i always bring that up¡±, it still doesn't change the way in which the game functions, or make the game a more playable and enjoyable experience. the walking dead onslaught is also very linear, in that you can¡¯t really get up close to static objects, or fully explore the environment - it¡¯s so frustrating. the developers didn¡¯t do themselves any favours or us for that matter, the extra nail in the coffin being the removal of co-op. personally, closer to the truth,  i think co-op was deemed as a hindrance to the launch date they had in mind, and rather than further delay its launch they decided to remove it.

by arranged targets, i mean for example: right roundhouse, left roundhouse, 2 left jabs, duck under obstacle.  that sort of thingread more.  the mapping for these songs seem to be automatically done using a program/algorithm and it kinda lacks the natural follow-through you have and doesn't really take advantage of your momentum and how arms work.  :) ",1615431600,4,,6057
"i never liked zombie themed games until i met this game. i like the fact that most of the game is played in daylight (hence the name). it's not based on jump scares - it does include some intense situations, but you always know they're coming. you move through beautiful sceneries and smash zombies on the way - immersively. the narration is fantastic. you really feel like you can connect with the character - his anger, his depression, his crazes.. this is what really made me connect with the game. yes, opening doors in the game is annoying, like others said, but other than that it's a really good buy!",1612149814,5, ,144741
"weird game to put it mildly. it starts off with you driving to the woods to take a rest in a cabin, you light a fire, night comes and then you get sucked into what appears to be an interdimensional vortex. you then end up in what appears to be a research facility where tests on the spacetime manipulator were/are being carried out. now begins your journey home. 

it sort of reminds me of portal but it's more action based rather than puzzle. one thing i will say is that the graphics in this game look gorgeous and bare in mind this was made by one person. it's not half life alyx so don't go in expecting that. overall based on what i've played so far this is an easy recommendation if you're looking for a decent vr shooter mixed with puzzle exploration and a decent amount of interaction with objects and the environment in general.",1725919201,0,,174626821

"i've been following this game since i was on standalone quest, downloading the demo(s) off of sidequest. i've sunk so much time into those earlier versions, so to see this on steam, still getting updates witha full roadmap, it really warms my heart.
gameplay is your basic rouge-lite experience. go into randomized dungeon with your sword and recall-able throwing knife, punt slimes like they're annoying golf balls, throw your knife at dangers you'd rather not deal with up close, find items and gold, find the boss door, [strike] wonder where the shop is, look at the map on your wrist and realize there was a fork in the path all the way near the entrance that you didn't explore, travel all the way back and purchase some items (or gamble away the money sometimes) [/strike] , fight the boss, go to next floor.
either i'm bad at video games (big possibility) or this game got hard. i can't seem to get past floor 2 or 3. but, it still is enjoyable, playing through what i have of the game. it's my go-to when i just want to get a run or two in before playing something else so i don't burn myself out on it.",1693797431,0,,145632437

"i am happy to change this review score if rec room address these issues.
i have been trying to play through 'the curse of the crimson cauldron' with my girlfriend, which we initially found to be quite good fun!
the biggest issue that we have with this game is that if both people die, you have to start again from the very beginning. so the further you get in the game, the more punishing it is to get back to where you were when you died.
if the 'check points' actually functioned as check points, and you started from the last one that you passed, then it wouldn't suck all of the fun out of the experience when you enter a new area, are ambushed, killed, and have to work your way back from the beginning.
making this worse is that the furthest that we have managed to get in the game, both times now, it became very buggy and crashed in the same area. 
combined with the lack of functioning check points, this made us give up on rec room and we haven't touched it in months, favouring less frustrating, more stable vr experiences.
please, make the 'check points' actually function as check points! we want to enjoy your game, but in it's current form, we can't!

"i'm a few hours into this title and having a blast. solid controls and unique visual style. performance has been flawless on the oculus go. the only reason i can't give this a 5 start rating is due to the significant eye and neck strain this game causes. this is something the devs can address.

when moving from one room to the next the screen fades out then the new room just loads in. you can go, for example, from the far upper right corner of one room to the far bottom left corner of the next room. there is no visual queue. you are left looking all over the screen to find yourself every time you switch rooms.

now go look at the actual castlevania and metroid games that inspired this game. the screen fades out but leaves the door and/or the character and slides this visual indicator to where you will be loading in. then the new room loads. no extra head and eye movement needed to find yourself and, as a result, so much less eye and neck fatigue. 

with an update this could be an easy 5 star game.",1564629814,5, ,36726

a very fun addition are the ""lost balls"", which are scattered around the world and when you find them, you can use them as your playing ball. on top of that, once you've completed the normal difficulty of a map, you unlock the harder version, which is slightly different, but also has a sort of treasure hunt/puzzle, which unlocks a unique club to use.

"when i stumbled across this game, i wasn't expecting too much to be honest. i've seen plenty of listings that seemed like they could be great games that end up barely meeting the standards of something playable. this game totally blows them out of the water. just wow. even though the game is relatively simple and not very long, there is so much to love.

this feels like a classic arcade zombie shooter like house of the dead, but with all of the mechanics updated and reworked to feel awesome in vr. the reloading mechanic is just arcade-y enough to not be tedious while also building tension and drama when you have a zombie running at you and your gun goes empty. the zombies and other monsters look amazing, and the decision to have a flashlight only on the pistol was genius. so many times i found myself reaching for the shotgun, only to realize that i'll be sacrificing my ability to see. the list goes on and on.

i have never been so pleasantly surprised by a free vr game; i'm almost worried that i've been forever spoiled. i bought the co-op dlc so i can play it with a friend, and it's like a whole new amazing experience. i feel like we only got a taste of what magic these devs are able to cook up, and i need more of it. they've earned a longtime fan in me, and i can't wait to see what the devs come out with in the future. i can't recommend this game and the co-op dlc enough.",1613855519,0,0,401398

We could always put it back in as an option, which we're big proponents of, but we just unanimously thought this one was a mistake.

you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/yg9fyfasqv4

this isn't the worst fireworks show i've seen in vr, but it also wasn't good enough to be charging money for it. although the fireworks themselves aren't that bad, everything else in this app is pretty bad. the ui is one of the ugliest i have ever seen in vr. 

the interactions are very basic. either point & click or touch the big button with the ugly looking thing you're holding on your motion controller. the environment is also very basic with an art-style that is reminiscent of the first 3d games ever made. the buildings can barely be called buildings because it's the lowest effort you can put on the visuals for it to be recognized as a building by the end user.

the game comes with 3 in-game songs. you can add your own music (wav format) and the fireworks will automatically fire off, but you can also manually fire some fireworks. game is running on the unreal engine. on my rtx 3080, i was getting 90 fps for the most part, with only a frame drop here and there.

i know this game is in early access. i hope the devs can improve the experience to make it something worth recommending in the future. however, currently, it's not worth recommending at any price.

the team killing is even worse than rainbow six annnd that¡¯s saying something,1599017014,5, ,230031
"so, let¡¯s keep it short and simple. i was reading the reviews trying to get myself to buy it.. (like you) and what did it for me was someone wrote, ¡°i know what your thinking, $40!? really?, but it¡¯s worth every dollar so buy it!¡± so i did. and boy am i satisfied. 
here¡¯s a quick breakdown¡­ 
(small note, graphic la and realism are pretty nice. been playing it for about a week and still chills when a walker comes after me) 
for starters, i¡¯m definitely not a campaign person. i can¡¯t get over the idea of buying a game, playing it, beating it and never touching it again, for that i usually stick to multiplayer, but given it¡¯s the infamous ¡®twd¡¯, i made an exception.  but given the play-time problem, i¡¯m definitely not disappointed, and didn¡¯t realize how grindy this game actually is. i thought i saw it was 18 hours (could be wrong) of total playtime before beating it¡­and while i¡¯m sure that¡¯s possible but it¡¯s have to be a speed-run/rushed. playing normally how i am, it¡¯s gonna be a very hot minute before the beat the game. there are so many things to craft, and with your supplies running out, you literally have to go on supply runs to keep your supplies stocked. now of course you don¡¯t have to but it makes your journey easier and more efficient. (and more realistic/immersion) so it¡¯s definitely grindy and you¡¯ll get the bang for your buck. but if you don¡¯t like grindy/storyline, there is a lower level difficulty (that i havnt tried), and a ¡°zombie wave¡± mode that looked pretty cool. 
speaking of story line, without spoiling it¡¯s not bad..not to quick like a cod sorry line, definitely more like gta/free roam based. there are like 10 different ¡°maps¡± you can go to. side missions with strangers during the revisit missions where you can choose how you want to handle it, (bad guy/good guy) which is pretty cool. 
again the crafting/crafting/supplies aspect is quite awesome. lots of cool things to craft. 
the games not super difficult but makes you think. i can¡¯t remember if i turned off helpful hints or something like that or not, but check it out in the options. 
couple cool things in the game from the show itself, again don¡¯t want to spoil, example some main character weapons.
each map/location has enemies (storyline will explain more) and these enemies defend/sit outside buildings @ those locations and enemies don¡¯t become hostile unless you go in the house.
besides that, only con is enemies are pretty dumb iq wise in the game, and their easy to take out one by one ¡®sometimes¡¯, but can overwhelm you in numbers sometimes, and will hunt you down, and just won¡¯t ¡°forget about you¡±.  also, some maps will have enemies not guarding a house but patrolling the map, and geared up as sh*t¡­so ya. 
anyways, that¡¯s about it. get the game. you¡¯re welcome.",1671722700,5, ,238266
its really fun but there is a problem. ive been playing only gun club vr because i love it so much but i already used all the guns in the games. i also added rails and stuff on it to make it more fun but it got boring so please in the next update add more guns and snipers also more targets like for real i get so bored after the other targets are used and also ads a thing were when u shoot them down they stay down and u can change it in the settings,1596943414,5, ,162848

note: this review was written after playing with a low-end, vr-capable gpu (nvidia geforce gtx 980)
**************************

skyrim vr is yet another re-release of vanilla skyrim which attempts to capitalise on a new platform with virtually no upfront investment on the developer's end. despite the plethora of fixes that have accumulated for each version over the years, this exceedingly demanding version has seemingly taken no cues from the modding community.

the visuals are terrible, the gameplay is clumsy, the performance is far from optimal - and the result is nauseating. the community consensus seems to be 'turn off all post-processing, then mod it' ...but should this work really be left to the player? vr is graphically taxing, so it's surprising to see that the in-game options are so lacking, and in many cases, inappropriate - such as the redundant supersampling setting when the headset can change resolution with less graphical demand.

using in-game settings alone, the 'optimal' result was still full of visual noise and blurred textures. yet after *days* of modding and remodding (to adjust textures and lighting), editing the .ini file (to correct aliasing issues and draw distances), and adjusting steam settings (for the resolution and virtually non-existent controller bindings), the game was finally in a playable state. 

all these adjustments could have been accounted for with a better thought-through settings menu and more developer support.

so if you're not prepared to spend more time editing this game than playing it, and you're not willing to suffer through a base game that's more nauseating than playable, then give this a hard pass.",1609295967,0,0,606160
"it¡¯s just a show of hands controlling a demo.  hand tracking still needs a lot of work because it is easy to get the quest to mis-track hands (putting them together in the water to rinse is a fail).  so, better than trying to control the ui with hands but you can¡¯t really call this a game. it¡¯s a short experience that will ultimately get deleted.",1590463414,5, ,293303

the physics here are noticeably different than racket fury. more force is required to push the ball to cross over the net and if you push a tiny bit more to goes out. requires lots of practice in my opinion. online gaming opponents are easy to find. ball spin physics are great. i still think the racket fury is more realistic especially for fast action table tennis.,1607657014,5,"hello cyberloo. I'll be happy to argue that point with you on our discord, or you can chat with the many many high level real life players who have tried both already and would disagree with you. 
Either way - if you prefer the physics of RF, that's awesome..you should always play the game you like more ... but when when it comes to realism, there is an objective truth :)

"--intro / tldr--
this game is too damn good. the story is gripping and fun, the graphics are good and the visuals are stylised well. this is definitely the best vr game ever, and in my opinion, the best game ever. not only is this game good, but its also game changing. it pushes the boundary of immersive gaming and physics-based gameplay.

--gameplay--
the gameplay is mainly physics-based combat and puzzles. the gunplay is the perfect combo of realistic, yet still fun. this creates a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling. the melee combat is good, but could be better. stabbing and punching feels great, but you cant really swing a sword at an enemy, the physics means that it will just lightly skim the enemy. swinging things like hammers and bats also feels great thanks to the amazing physics. the puzzles are a bit too few, however i would rather have them too few than too plentiful. they usually have you moving around physics objects to help you get from point a to point b. however, don't let the simplicity of the idea make you think that the puzzles are simple. the puzzles take just the right amount of thinking to get right. they don't make you stand there for hours, but they are still challenging enough to be rewarding. the game also comes with 3 modes, the campaign (this is missing from a lot of vr games), the arena, and the sandbox. the arena mode has two sub-arenas, one which features a call of duty zombies-style gamemode, and the other which features more standard wave modes. the sandbox is great fun, and allows you to setup whatever you want with the physics items that you pickup throughout the campaign.

--story--
the story of this game, is, in my opinion awesome. however, i think you'll either love it or think it's non-existant. the ""surface level"" story is pretty mediocre, and is delivered mainly through talking to characters through screens. this story is, however, massively expanded upon through the world building. the game takes inspiration from portal, by having a lot of the story given to you via writing on the walls, and the museum level at the beginning. this level serves two purposes, it introduces you to the game mechanics, and it introduces you to the lore. if you pay attention, then you will get a lot of the story and will probably love it, but if you prefer to shoot first and read later then you will miss a lot of it.

--preformance--
the game has pretty standard requirements for a modern vr game. my rig is as follows:
i7-8700
16gb
vega 56
this setup allows me to run the game well on my vive + knuckles vr setup. the game runs great and never really drops low enough to cause motion sickness. (unless you spawn hundreds of things in sandbox mode)

--graphics--
the game looks pretty good, however the game really shines in it's design. the textures and models are all consistent with the type of world that the devs are trying to build. it is truly immersive.

--sound design--
the games music is really good, and fits in perfectly with the world. in the endgame, is where the music really shines through. it genuinely sends shivers down my spine every time i hear it. the enemies also have great sound design that allows you to easily identify what enemy you are about to encounter. all the enemies sound distinct, and the sound fits perfectly with the models.

--vr--
this game truly breaks the boundaries that vr games are usually made within. the game has the best vr climbing, the best un-tracked vr full body, the best vr guns, the best vr menu interaction, and the best vr physics and much more. it definitely feels like the most well-rounded vr game ever. unpopular opinion (kind of): this game is better than hl:a. hl:a is not bad, not at all, but it still has a trace of that ""2016 vr game"" feel. where you have floating hands, you can't pick holster your gun, no two handed weapons etc.

--other notable things--
1. this game may cause motion sickness. the warning at the start of the game is not joke. advanced vr users only. if this game does cause you motion sickness then you can refund it. just please bare in mind that the game does warn you of this.
2. this review was made with my experience on the valve index controllers and oculus touch controllers in mind. if you are using vive wands, then beware that this game may be harder to play on them due to the lack of a joystick and the awful grip buttons. index and oculus controllers work great, but vive wands do not, and windows mr controllers fall right into the middle.",1606410856,0,1,715236

secondly it needs a ruler measurement tools and the ability to create  object with a set size. i wanted to create frame structure and different building components and stack it up lego-like to demonstrate ways to eliminate thermal bridges. 
i can kind of achieve it by using grid and eyeball the approximate size but really would like to have a precise way to build it.

"""belko vr: an escape room experiment"" is an okayish but unfortunately incomplete vr tech demo, it's a small and unambitious ""escape room"" game with just a tiny amount of content.  due to the apparently abandoned nature of this tech demo, it's difficult to recommend.

the graphics in this game are passable, but could be better.  and while it's vital for any game to have impressive visuals (gaming is a visual medium, after all), there's more to a game than just the graphics.  to be worth a gamers time, the game must match top tier visuals with top tier gameplay, and that's not happening here.

not every ""free"" game really is.  there's often mtx, or content locked behind dlc, or donations being requested, or any other number of things that could mislead gamers, but in this case i'm glad to say this really does appear to be a fully free game.

nothing demonstrates a developers belief in themselves and their work than giving it away without any remuneration.  this is a service to themselves, and the gaming industry, and should be applauded.  of course, just because something is free, doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable.

even though this is ""free"", it failed to appeal to the 120 million+ gamers on steam.  steamdb showed the game peaked at just a dozen or so concurrent players, and now there's basically nobody playing it.  even though it's free.  this is a dismal public reception, but it's easy to see why gamers rejected it.

bearing in mind that free games don't add +1 to your game collector count, should you bother adding this to your library and downloading it?

this is a ""maybe"" experience... if you have a lot of free time on your hands and nothing else to do, why not?  but for the purposes of a review, this isn't something i can say everyone must try.  it's not quite there.  valve doesn't give us a ""maybe"" option in reviews, but if they did, that's what i'd choose for this.",1732275946,0,,179563825

"quite buggy but also very good game.

the gameplay is fun, with a good choice of weapons combination (pistols, shields, magic staff, swords, axes, a big ass hunting rifle...).

coop multiplayer is definitely a blast.",1593970442,3,0,578454
"this is a spectacular game, i have well over 20 hours in it and just passed 100 days in game. the quick? buy it. it is fun, scary, and immersive. but you might want to see my note precise opinions if you really want to see what i¡¯ve experienced.

pros:
-the mechanics feel great when they work.

-the world feels cold, immersive, and has a constant sense of unease. you may think you can take on a fight just to get mobbed and barely make it out alive.

-though not explained too thoroughly, the scavenging, the weapons and crafting keeps me coming back just to be more prepared for the next fight.

-the difficulty scales with the time if you spend a few days periodically to scavenge. early game? it can be a bit rough if you follow the quests immediately as they appear, a bit of prep goes a long way. late-post game? you are still scavenging gear to make sure you¡¯re ready! a single run to a location can consume entire stocks of ammo, meds, and melee durability. it keeps things tense and fun.

-though some hate the durability and stamina system, i love it. it keeps things slow, plotting, and intense. it is after all a survival horror first and action second. and there is a way around this! if you¡¯re ok with having lower stamina, and would prefer to focus on heaving more health, it can never degrade below half so you can use stamina more frequently if you¡¯re comfortable with the area.

cons:
-as said earlier at time the game mechanics can feel a bit unpolished, sometimes a fast broad swing of my sword with just bounce off a person or zombie like i flung a piece of paper at them. sometimes the guns and sword feel a bit too wavy or ¡°heavy¡± for some gear, and if this was early apocalypse i¡¯d understand especially if he is untrained, but the waviness of the weapons doesn¡¯t suit someone who regularly uses this gear to survive. if feels like he is constantly just letting the weight of the weapon move him around instead of him working with the weapon to get the job done.

-i do still experience some bugs with the world destabilizing, people seeing me through walls etc. though this is few and far between it is noticeable when it happens.

-this is a huge nitpick but when compared the the brutal believability of the melee weapons, the guns could have a bit more immersive. have a more manual interaction while reloading, more deep intimidating noises, the way people react when they get hit, etc. 

overall? i do recommend this game! i lost countless hours lost in the swampy world of new orleans. it feels like a well realized story with fantastic mechanics, but it does feel a bit unpolished in a few areas keeping it from a perfect 5/5.",1605151414,5, ,243687

"i see what they were going for but the game is hard. not challenging. its hard because the game is slow and janky and unresponsive. the game is not lazy. it clearly has a vision that in my opinion just hasn't been fully realized.

pro-good variety of weapons

the level, character design is interesting

there seems to be a good deal of content available

coop multiplayer is definitely a plus

the game is a bit janky but i haven't really seen any bugs so thats good.


cons- the games graphics are somewhere between ps2 and ps3 but its a quest title so i give that a pass if the art direction is interesting and it is so this is a really minor nitpick

this is the big one for me...
the blocking almost never works. the game spawns dudes periodically without doing anything notify the player. the ai will cause enemies to flank behind players and just barrage the player with a flurry of attacks which makes them nearly unavoidable.

player speed is a crawl. there is a feature that allows players to do a quick dodge which relies on me holding a trigger and nodding my head in the direction i want to dodge but again its janky, so i spend a good deal of time banging my head with a 3 lb headset on hoping that it does what i want it to do. it will interpret very slight head movements as an attempt to dodge and ignore obvious attempts which is just no. i hate this feature. 

all in all i can see this being a great game but for me its just not there yet. i'll update my review as patches drop for it and take another crack at it. i don't remember how much they charged for it but i'd say its worth $10 or $15 but if its $20 i gotta give it a pass until the iron out a few of the details.",1578453814,5,"Hi there, it's pretty clear you had issues with our dash system and movement in general and we appreciate the candid feedback.

"finished the game in one sitting on day of release, now i don't have much to do until people make release mods t_t

story: the story is pretty short, and a good chunk of it is actually unlocking avatars to switch between, which is really unfortunate because its really fun when you have the freedom to switch between them, but all of it was still a blast.

graphics: graphics are a huge step up from boneworks, the dynamic lighting fascinated me in the prologue.

gameplay: the gameplay is really fun, especially since you are now encouraged to use guns more rather than save as much ammo as possible for vending machines at the end of the game. (or any part of the game for that matter) your weapons are also saved between levels which is kinda nice. switching between avatars is really fun, switching to the heavy avatar and bitch slapping enemies out of existence will never get old.

replayability: while i wouldn't say there is a lot of post-game hub content, there's a lot more than what boneworks had at launch, and there is something fun to do for every itch you might need to scratch. there are also loads of collectibles in each level, and the reclamation bin is no more, just hold and pull apart the orbs with both hands to add it for use in sandbox instead of carrying a bunch of bouncy orbs to the end of the level. even with the relatively low amount of post-game content, mods should hopefully spice up the experience very soon, with user generated levels, avatars, etc.

overall: this game is pretty solid. while its hard to recommend to most people now (unless you are a die-hard boneworks fan) its pretty fun, but its probably best to wait a few weeks for people to release mods or for the game to go on sale.
7.5/10 (for now)

edit: mods are in higher availability now, and while its mostly avatars with just a few sandbox/parkour levels, punching the shit out of a nullbody as adam smasher from 2077 is pretty fun.",1664583060,0,,123107846

"game is super fun! however if you have a week stomach or get dizziness in vr easily, you probably wont enjoy this. lots of fast movement!

i enjoyed flying around and exploring the environment very much. you are on a hover board most of the time (it can be taken off), you've got rocket booster hands to help propel you through the air, grappling hooks to aid in this as well, and a ray gun to shoot week points of bosses and drones. the object is to use your map and hunt down the area's bosses. if you like to explore, there are smaller drone-like enemies and if you beat those, they drop a buff to one of your unlocked abilities. there are also hidden mods to find all over the island. the boss fights remind me of shadow of the colossus in that you have to look around on them for their week points and then destroy those points to defeat them. they scale in difficulty as the game requires you to improve with your abilities as you go to each boss.

there doesn't seem to be much of a story here so don't expect a gripping tale.

i was able to defeat all bosses and then go back and find all the drones to max my abilities in about 5-6 hours spent over 3 play sessions.

"i went into this game with some high expectations, so perhaps i set myself up to be disappointed but even within the first few minutes of the game i found myself unable to continue for a few reasons:

- the movement of my in-game hands was not synchronised to the movement of my real life hands, so it felt as though my hands were being pulled along by strings.

- the were some stuttering issues whenever i moved my head lower than a certain point which really messed with my head.

- the interactions between objects didn't feel very fulfilling. knives would seem very slow and not cut through objects in a way i would expect them to, and objects very unsatisfyingly snapped to the spatula which felt very stiff.

- this point may seem like a bit of a nitpick since it stemmed from my own expectations going into the game rather than anything shown in promo material. tied into the above point, objects snapping into place in my hands and not allowing for me to grab them at multiple different angles was quite underwhelming since that's something i've come to expect in other vr games, and i was slightly disappointed when my knife didn't penetrate the cutting board when i stabbed at it.

as the game currently stands, i can't bring myself to play any more.",1628283304,2,0,399821
"while there are many amazing multiplayer games on the quest, elven assassin is one that truly nails the co-op experience. the mechanics and hit detection are very good, especially when leading your shot when firing at an incoming dragon and knowing you can focus your attention on the charging enemies as the dragon spirals towards the ground. shooting an arrow to move to a different location is intuitive and adds a fun and skillful element to the game. the magic arrows add even more excitement as a foe quickly approaching the gate is frozen solid and shattered by a friend in another tower. the levels are varied, ranging from ships approaching a beach to icy mountain views, and 2 even include an escort-style challenge through valleys and caves. dodging axes thrown at you and seeing them stick into the wooden post right near your head further adds to the experience. pvp is also a great time as the shoot-to-move mechanic leads to a strategic and thrilling battle (although we would love to be able to hide the names above enemies to further increase the challenge!). we will definitely be loading up this one for many future gaming nights!",1649551200,5, ,168676

"this game is very nice, i can see a lot of resemblance to into the radius (which is a good thing) so i will compare it to that a lot.

heres some things it does better than itr:
-the ladders are very easy to use.
-theres more armor and customization for pockets and such.

and here's some things i wish it did more like itr:
-i wish there was button for item tooltip or something like that, to know what i'm looking at (i'm not good with ammo and attachments names).
-a side pocket for items, maybe on the left hip, not for mags or grenades, just for random stuff i pick up.


beyond this point in the review there will be spoilers on pros and cons of this game, and later on suggestions, so be aware.

i think this game is actually really nice, theres definitely a few issues but its still really fun!

heres a few things that i noticed and made the game's experience better for me:
-i had no lag issues, or fps drops, the game runs well!
-the guns looks quite nice, and handle well from what i've touched.
-the buildings are easy to navigate and not too confusing or repetitive.
-the co-op works well! you can interact with your friend's backpack and slots, but you can't heal them.
-this game gives me a lot of dopamine.
-most guns that have a movable stock actually have that feature, wheter it's foldable or slides, it just works!


some cons, but keep in mind that its not ruining the game, just things that in my opinion could be changed:
-buying water seems a little weird, it'd be cool to be able to refill them in a raid or something.
-theres a part in the tutorial vhs that talks about crafting, but i haven't seen the crafting machine.
-some bunker doors in the bunker take colored key cards but give them back (edit, they're for dlc content but  doesn't tell you..), theres also a keycard reader in the big underground garage but it doesn't take any key cards..?
-the game is super dark in some areas, sometimes its on purpose, but sometimes its kinda annoying, i wish there was like a pocket flashlight you could buy or find.
-the game has some big physics issues! things clipping through the floor or through walls, falling out of your backpack when trying to place stuff. i hope this gets improved on!
  -killed a good fella and opened his backpack, but then it started gmod propflying into the sea, leaving me with nothing but a dead friend in the encounter.
-sometimes me and my friend just spawn on complete opposites of the map. (thats bad, you can guess why)
-bots sometimes are completly blind to your presence, but sometimes sees you miles away while looking somewhere else. i think that crouching and stealth elements could work well to change bot combat. it definitely doesn't need to get harder, just fixed.


and here's some personal suggestions, just things i'd like to see in the game:
-missions that spawn things that you have to get, clientside item that you have to extract with. maybe something you can put in your backpack or something you have to hold (for more money).
-puzzles, turn on generator in one place to go somewhere else, because it does look like that in some places but then ends up being nothing.
-maybe alarm traps, very visible lasers to avoid, that don't kill you but trigger an alarm, so you could ""barricade"" ways into a building. (it'd be cool to see more locks as well)
-binoculars so i can spot for my friend.
-co-op bunker, sharing a storage area and all with your friend sounds sick.
-being able to get teammates back in the raid once they die but i survive, i've had one too many times where my friend dies or i die and we need to wait for the other to finish the raid.



will update the review for more as i play more!

edit 06/10/23:
this game is still really fun, but the bugs really make the experience way worse than it could be.

-grabbing my friends, or enemy's backpacks has a good 50% of having it spin in my hand randomly when its open, closing it stops it, but since picking it up opens it again its a major annoyance..
-sometimes ammo just dissapears, my friend went in with full mags and multiple times those mags ended just being empty, and that's a deadly issue.
-i looted a barrett with a full mag, and when i put it on my gun wall, it just lost all its ammo, and 50cal costs 1 brass per bullet so its really expensive. it also got stuck inside the gunwall and i almost lost it..
-the vending machine sometimes just takes my items but i can't sell them or turn them in, they're just sent to the backrooms and never refunded.

if you know any fix or tips, i'd love to hear them in comments, and i hope this game gets update soon as well, last update was pretty nice!",1684552279,0,,138585566

"i got this in the sale and also used a wallet refund. so, dirt cheap-ish. had a blast playing this on my oculus quest (link) worked great and i have had a blast.
i think i explored the whole map, i tried to go everywhere, i tried not to miss anything and so between that and dying i was 36 hours from start to finish. sometimes annoyed by the odd puzzle but still having fun.

best vr game ever?  hmmm, it's up there but asgard, wrath of gods and lone echo also spring to mind plus the multitude of simulation race and flight sims etc. but yea, if you have vr then go for it. 9/10.

"this could very well be one of my all time favorite games if it were not for one terrible flaw - the save points. it is an amazing game, beautiful, immersive, smooth gameplay, but you cannot save your game except at select checkpoints (which are few and far between) and once you progress beyond your save point it overwrites everything! utterly ridiculous and infuriating. i have managed to make it maybe 25% of the way through the game, but i am literally back at the very beginning again. i'm probably not gonna play it anymore unless the devs fix it. let me save my game!!!",1599967414,5,"Hey stonecraftarts,
Thank you for your feedback, if the game is working correctly (we think it is but can you email us at hello@superbright.org just to make sure) then what you're seeing is how roguelites work - you're starting from the same place in the game, but you've actually probably unlocked new enemies, new arrows, maybe even new areas in the game. You can then play differently, set goals for yourself or compete in tournaments when they're on, and reach a higher score on the ladders. In other words it might feel like starting over but every play through matters and moves you towards unlocking new content in the game that can then be played more efficiently, with different risk/rewards and more.

On top of this, we're working on a new game mode with something different for our players that we think you'll find interesting, please send us your thoughts and feedback at hello@superbright.org - we love hearing from our players!",176297

i finished the first ten levels. i had awful times on some, but incredible fun every time.

ok the game play is on rails like all the half life games but i do think like all of the half life games it has replayability, i cant wait to see if there is a follow up or dlc even if its just half life 2 re-done in this engine, and albeit the puzzles can sometimes be a pain they are just right and a good distraction/rest from just looking to shoot/kill enemies.

"good game and as some who loves survival horror definitely has evil within and re4 vibes. 

my big glaring issue is the pick up system why can you both toggle to pickup items and or hold down button to grab/hold and release objects or weapons.

 why is this not an option to turn on and off in the menus it's vary annoying how it just swaps back and forth between the two making the game badly frustrating. 

and just picking up things like shotgun shells and pistol ammo is a game of find the circle and dont let you pick them up even when your on top of them.

and don't even bother with melee just throw them it seems like that's what they had in mind for them since they stick into enemies even when holding them in to hands

i get use to the controls in just about every survival horror ps1 and onwards if it's compelling enough but in vr iv never wanted to hit something in real life so bad. it's a different kind of discouraging

"this game is awesome and unlike anything else in vr. it's sort of like a combination between beat saber and super hot. 

a major problem for me is *it isn't playable on pc.* only on quest. there's some issue with adrenaline drivers that makes most of the textures not load. after updating to adrenaline 2020, there's now a weird stereoscopic issue that's even worse than the missing textures. i haven't encountered these problems in any other games.

another complaint is dodging walls is frustratingly difficult. i feel like it's buggy and that my timing on the dodges is perfect, but about 80% of the time i hit one anyway. this is a really common complaint with the game and the devs should rework the collision or spacing of those walls.

"on oculus rift

i am enjoying this so far. 

the locomotion is a little to be desired. you have to hold down a button to move in the direction you are looking in.
would be better if an option for track pad movement so we could look around while we are moving. not to mention 
the lack of speed of your character which makes it feel artificial and a bit sickening in places. 

ok so with that said, why am i enjoying the game?  
it is genuinely creepy. there are puzzles to solve. this is not the usual type of game i play and i was a bit hesitant 
to buy it but i am glad i did. i have not played it all the way through yet and am excited to get back to it.

"pool vr is the best game for the vive at the moment, its the only game that does not feel like a tech demo. i have only played alone (not even a match against ai) and the first thing i tried out was the physics of hitting balls and i was little disappointed i could not put a spin on the white ball and have it bounce of the walls in different angles, however when i turned of some settings to help you aim, spinning the ball got enabled and i could hit the ball exactly like i do in real life and it was a amazing feeling how well it is translated into the game.

this game is great i can only recommend it to anyone who has any interest in pool

pros+
+complete pool experience
+great physics
+feels like playing the real thing (have a pool table at work) once you get used to the controls i got used to it after 1-2 games
+great environment and ambient sound that really takes you away from your room and into a bar.
+progression and unlocks

cons-
-not a lot of settings, you can't tweak what happens between different graphics sets (low, medium, high, ultra) 
also not a lot of sound options
for some reason my framerate was locked to 45fps but i will investigate, i am not sure its the game that locks it there.
-no sound when balls hit the walls on the pool table, i am expecting a  low *thump* sound when the ball hits the soft table cloth wall but it is not there for me. (especially the white ball)

this is a reminder that i have not even played multiplayer or against ai yet and i am expecting my impression of the game to get even better!

the only thing i wish they'd add is the possibility to comment on videos. yes, pointing on letters one by one is not a good used experience, but still beats having to remove your headset. plus make liking videos easier (with some bigger icon closer to the center of the view), as i bet that currently many people don't like any videos while they use vr, which would be important feedback/motivation for content makers.",1535253814,5, ,36419

"tldr: saw game from years ago and finally got into vr this year. game updates seem to have downgraded every part of this game from what i saw in youtube videos years ago. while the devs seem to want to fix this in it's current state it feels lifeless and more like a vr light-gun game. can't recommend in current state as other games have better features, some of which this game once had. also had issues running the game even tho my pc was over min spec.

graphics: 5/10 (average for vr)
gameplay: 4/10 (could be fun pvp or with friends but other vr shooters feel a lot better)

some friends and i got into vr this year and have been having a blast with tactical assault vr which is an amazing game, however this caused us to play it so much we just want more content as we know the maps like the back of our hand. this made me remember seeing onward years ago when a bunch of youtubers i watch played it. i figured i'd pick it up and give it a try as if we can get another tactical shooter for our group then it'd help the burnout of just playing one game. i was sad to learn that the game had a massive downgrade to work on standalone headsets but heard the devs were trying to fix it and figured i'd give it a go.

after playing i see why people are upset and to me the game feels lifeless, the ai just stand there, the game ran poorly on my system despite being  well over min spec, and simple things like ragdoll being gone just made the whole thing feel like a lifeless shooting gallery. i played with settings but i just couldn't stop the stutters and loading issues despite having played games with much more going on on screen and better graphics. overall it was just a disapointment to jump into this years after it's prime and not be the game people were excited about years ago.

"the suspense of trying to figure out how to craft a huge vertical beach hut... ok, 7 wooden poles stuck end to end, with a bamboo pedestal on top, with your trusty shotgun in hand, watching the sun slowly glow through the sky, awaiting the inevitable nightfall, and zombie/creature rampage, is just that... suspense (early march, will update review once survival's in)  but it's suspense, done so well. the graphics and ambience are beautiful.  the in-game radio's are really great, with up to date, real world news.  i was lying on my couch, listening to waves crashing in a storm, with world politics playing calmly in the background, when i realised almost an hour went by with my eyes closed and my headset still on.  the atmosphere is amazing already, and i gotta ask, to make it friendly to 'all' gamesters, that survival mode becomes an 'option', and not mandatory, but personally i can't wait for survival mode.",1520131589,0,1,595546
"not recommended for watching youtube 360 videos in vr. once you enable vr viewing, it has a really hard time loading any video at over 720p (which looks super blurry in vr), setting it to 1080 or higher caused the video to buffer every 5-10 seconds and stutter constantly. i didn't even try to see if i could get it to display properly otherwise (proper viewing angle and 3d format, etc.), tried to tinker with settings for a bit but the buffering and stuttering was so bad i gave up pretty fast. furthermore, some videos just straight-up won't play, claiming your system doesn't have enough resources, which i'm pretty sure is not true on my machine but -definitely- not true on my partner's rather powerful machine, which i also had him try it on. the main video i was interested in was one such video that would not load at all.

on the one hand, as far as i can tell this is the only free vr video player that will -actually- stream 360-degree videos from youtube in vr (deovr claims to be able to do this but it does not seem to work anymore). but it does not play them super well, and you'll only get smooth playback on lower-quality videos that will look really blurry in your headset. my recommendation for watching 360-degree youtube videos in vr is virtual desktop classic, which you have to pay for and does not actually stream the videos, it downloads them locally for playback, but the playback there was perfect so it's really your best bet.",1699804040,0,,150009574

"this is my first time really writing a review for a game, but this one is so good that i felt the need to. it walks the line between challenging and frustrating so well, and the story is immersive and real-feeling enough that even when i did feel like quitting out of frustration, the need to see what would happen next kept me going through it. the visuals are also stunning, especially for such a low-poly art style, but perhaps the thing i liked most about it was the music. it doesn't always show up, but whenever it does it's always a pleasant surprise that tugs on the heartstrings with just a few notes. i've been looping the main theme for days ever since i finished the game lol.
     the only potential downsides for me, personally, was the motion sickness and a few limitations on the ""sitting"" mode of playing. while the game does have a teleport only option to move around, the nature of solving the puzzles makes it incredibly frustrating, if not impossible, so get around solely by teleport, so using the free roaming option is somewhat inevitable. that said, i managed to get around this by simply closing my eyes when free roaming was necessary, but it's still something to be aware of.
    the second downside is that when you're sitting, a few of the puzzles are impossible to solve. there is one particular puzzle (that i believe was shown in the trailer) in which you reach into a wishing well to grab a key, but the sitting mode doesn't allow you to reach down far enough to grab it. this can be solved by changing the mode to standing for a few seconds and then you can go back to sitting, but it's something that took me a long time to figure out.
    even with those downsides, though, it's still absolutely worth five stars and its story is a thought provoking one that is sure to squeeze at your heart. the puzzles are also super fun and feel very rewarding to solve, especially if it takes you a long time to crack it.",1559013814,5, ,344831

do i think it is perfect; nope 

pros: your walking around in fallout 4 

cons;  a lot some textures are poorly renedered and the magnified scopes on the weapons do not work. (i was very disapointed when i found that out through experience)

is it worth 59.99 that is up to the buyer if you always wanted a more immersive fallout then go ahead. it is not a mircale worker if you are buying because you think it will make the vive do magic, it will not and you have wasted your money.

this is the whole reason i bought the oculus. i played it once and had to have it. i went out and bought the oculus the next day.  looking for the next adventure in gaming this game has it all.   while i use my oculus or other games and experiences like the 360 videos. this game deserves the credit for what vr gaming is all about. 10 stars.,1591932214,5, ,86734
"okay, where to start.

this game has some decent gameplay loops every now and then and it sure looks promising. but at the moment it is just that, handling weapons is rather stiff. (and i dont mean that its not h3vr levels of weapon handling,) the game is still rather barebones. (especially the lack of healing options come to mind.)


my personal feelings aside: the most important thing to keep in mind is that ""into the radius"" is very much still in beta.
this might not be a problem for you because for example you've seen the pictures on the store page and decided that it was worth to buy this game... however! beta means that everything is subject to change, and changed it has, which is why i will leave a negative review and urge people not to buy this game (yet...?)
there is a solid chance that you will end up being dissapointed because one of your favourite features gets cut out or changed (looking at the steam forums, you wouldnt be the first one)
so again, its not wise to buy this game now. you have no clue what it will turn into, and im suspecting the developers arent that certain yet either.


[i] now it is time for the elephant in the room.  [/i] 
is this game similar to s.t.a.l.k.e.r.? [i] no, not at all! [/i] (if you are looking for an experience like s.t.a.l.k.e.r. a good game to pick up is s.t.a.l.k.e.r., duh) there are no npc's for example. (will they get added later? who knows, they arent in the game now.) the gameplay is also considerably more forgivable, perhaps this is done because a ""real"" s.t.a.l.k.e.r. game in vr would probably be excruiciatingly difficult. 
and third of all, for me the main reason to not look at this game like ""s.t.a.l.k.e.r. - experience"" is the completely different atmosphere. s.t.a.l.k.e.r. is like a terrible nightmare, where into the radius is more like a fever dream. (if that makes sense to anyone who hasnt played both games ill be impressed)
now personally i do hold the developers accountable for this confusion and the borderline ""bandwagoning"" on s.t.a.l.k.e.r.s. legendary status. on the storepage it even mentions ""a roadside picnic"" the book that has (in the 21st century) pretty much become synonymous with the s.t.a.l.k.e.r. series, (and imo nowadays mostly gets mentioned when people make a game like s.t.a.l.k.e.r. but feel they are regarded as copycats if they mention the game directly)

now finally to end on a positive note: i have had some enjoyable hours in into the radius before and i won't deny that ill have them again, my major reasoning to urge people not to buy this game is because the chance of your features being cut out (or left as an older variant with little updates and the improvements that those updates bring!) is rather high, so for now: keep your money but come back to this game every now and then to look how the development is going. 

to conclude ill ask the development team if they mind adding an ""electro anomaly"" because honestly, that be incredibly cool, and would broaden the dangers that the 
[strike] zone [/strike], ehm... i mean radius brings

"absolutely stunning vr game!

the gameplay aspects of this one have been refined to near perfection. i enjoyed walking around the world picking things up casually with the gravity gloves. it really becomes like second nature after the first few times you use it. simply amazing!

shooting, reloading, throwing grenades and combat overall feels really enjoyable. i love to take the extra second to aim and find the weak spots of the enemies to get that satisfying one shot kill.
also timing the grenades perfectly to blow up right next to the enemies was one of my sources of pure satisfaction.

all of this happens in an extremely detailed environment where there's countless objects you can interact with.
when i entered a room of any kind i always took some time to look around for some extra ammo and resin. it really made me notice the tiny details they put in. the developers clearly knew that people would be snooping around so they made sure to leave something there for them as well.

alongside with all of that the game has you panicking with trying to reload during a battle while your glove is showing zero hearts and your ammo is running out. even the stealthy parts have you holding your breath to not drop any items and give away your position.

"half life alyx is one of the greatest vr experiences i have ever had. the gameplay, controls, and graphics are on point. almost all the sound design is taken from the original half life 2. the environment is beautifully creepy. don't even get me started on the headcrabs! the gameplay is a fun action shooter as well as a horror walk through. overall if you have a vr headset this should be a game you should buy full price for. this one of my favorite vr game next to blade & sorcery. once again valve exceeded my expectations! 10/10",1585180453,0,0,555917

"many probably know them from various mangas and animes, the cute rice balls. in fact, they are very popular in japan as a handy snack. the amount of rice indicated above is enough for 6 onigiri. important: definitely use sushi rice, otherwise the onigiri won't hold together! you can find two more onigiri recipes here and here.

first, put the rice in a pot and wash it. fill the pot with water until the rice is covered and then swirl it around with your hand for a few seconds. then pour off the cloudy water. repeat this process until the water remains clear (about 3-4 times). (the purpose of this is to remove any impurities from the rice, as well as excess starch, which could make the rice slimy.)

bring the rice to a boil with 300 ml of water over high heat. once foam begins to rise in the pot, turn off the heat and let the rice rest on the warm stovetop for 15 minutes. very important: never remove the lid while the rice is cooking and resting! it is quite easy to determine when the rice is boiling in a pot with a glass lid. with a metal lid, you may need to experiment a bit. if the boiling rapidly increases within a few seconds, the rice should be ready and the heat can be turned off.
transfer the rice to a hangiri or another large, flat, non-metal container and plow and turn the rice with a wide wooden spoon - preferably a shamoji. at the same time, use a fan to cool the rice as quickly as possible. (this works better with two people ~_^). be sure to avoid crushing the individual grains when turning! cool the rice in this way to about 40??c.

for 6 onigiri with katsuobushi:

? pack (2.5g) katsuobushi
6 strips of nori (12x5cm)

divide the rice into six portions. moisten hands with water and take half a portion in one hand, flatten it with the other hand, and shape it into a triangle or circle as desired. sprinkle ? g of katsuobushi in the middle. place the other half of the rice portion on top and press it into the desired shape. finally, wrap a strip of nori around the onigiri as shown on the picture on the far right.

for 6 onigiri with egg:

2 eggs
1 leveled teaspoon of sugar
? teaspoon of salt oil for frying

beat the eggs with sugar and salt and fry them to make dry scrambled eggs. mix the scrambled eggs with rice. divide it into six portions. form a rice ball from each portion.

for 6 onigiri with umeboshi:

6 umeboshi (pickled plums)
12 strips of nori (20x3cm)

divide the rice into six portions. shape each portion into a rice ball. press one umeboshi into the center of each ball. wrap each onigiri with two strips of nori.

for 6 onigiri with miso:

2 teaspoons of miso
2 teaspoons of sake
2 teaspoons of mirin

mix miso, sake, and mirin. form six onigiri from the rice. heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. fry the onigiri for about two minutes, then flip and brush the already fried side with the miso sauce. flip again after a minute.",1706562697,0,,157145389
"great so far,

nice, turn-based tactical combat. it accurately channels miniature based tabletop dungeon crawlers, and gets you thinking about your next moves. i've only played the single-player so far, because i didn't want to embarrass my team! get some practice in. that said, i had a lot of fun even in single-player.

"this is a cool tool, but no way would i ever use this enough to justify a subscription. i use mind mapping all the time, and while i don't mind paying one time, i definitely won't pay monthly for this. 

this isn't a phone. the cloud features are a lazy justification. this kind of software doesn't need a ton of bells and whistles. easily can be stand-alone.  greedy greedy greedy. 

i'd pay maybe $30. total. 

plenty of one time cost mind mapping software out there. not to mention it's just replacing what's done best with a paper and pen or microsoft visio. the social features only matter if literally anyone i worked with had a quest.

you can do social vr white boarding in big screen and now in horizon workroom. actually, i'm pretty impressed with horizon.

"it's a works in progress for sure, but i love the concept of being inside a game with the developer and hearing about the processes that went into building the game.

as far as a critique of the quadrilateral cowboy episode goes, they did a good job on the interface and scenes. the stage looked great and i liked the interactive timeline. the quadrilateral cowboy game scene was fun and interesting as well.

in regards to content, will did a good job of hosting but brendon chung was a bit drab. he didn't give us a lot of insight into his thought processes for the game, he just kinda chuckled the whole time. will kept trying to pull info from him, but brendon's answers were mostly two words long, that was pretty disappointing. also, the live audience and jump cuts need more work or to be avoided all together, but this is not a finished product, so i don't want to be overly critical at this point in the game.

the foo show is a really great concept and i'm excited to see where else they take it, looking forward to watching more episodes. also, thanks to will for trying something different and pushing this new medium forward!",1489549784,3,0,594868

"the developers have done a huge job in immersing the player in the environment. lockers, drawers, beers, things you expect to open, pull, grab, are all things you can do in this game. there are no hints for it, no special colours. they simply exist in the world for you to interact with, like you would expect from real life. but of course, there is more to the game than just this.

gun play is fun, and the closeness of enemies creates a lot more tension than prior games in the series was able to. you'll meet enemies that you know (and love) from the other games, but seeing headcrabs leap at you, zombies stagger towards you, and manhacks fly straight at you, is a whole other level. 

the story is great, set pieces are amazing, and i quite enjoyed the characters interacting with eachother.

"sci-fi shooter goodness.

this is a good graphical challenging sci-fi vr shooter with a slight story to it. the first levels are not too challenging but as you progress it gets harder. you can redo the levels to get a better score on the leaderboards if that is your taste. this game has more than one form of locomotion to choose from. arm-swing is the highlight form of movement and it is implemented very well. the guns are fairly easy to use and auto reload is synonymous with an arcade type game which this is even though it is free roaming and has various levels. the devs recently added melee weapons to the game. perfect for those who like getting more of a workout although i am not sure it is practical in this kind of game. just my opinion. the sound effects are satisfying and the interaction in the game adds to the immersion of being there and having a purpose. as i said the game starts slow to help you get used to the game play but paces up as you venture through each level. my main gripes with the game is that the way some levels are set up it is difficult to form a strategy because of enemy locations. shooting far away the guns can be in-accurate. and some enemies damage was way too high in my opinion. these are not anti-fun issues though. they can be worked around but i am sure the developer will work on tweaking the game some more. this is worth a buy if you like exploration, large levels, and shooters in vr. my rating is a 7/10. 

i played this game in one of my game medley sessions. it is a live re-run and unedited so vidicta is the second video in the trio. fast forward to it. the video below the first is more recent and has 4k resolution and it is only vindictus game play. thanks and enjoy.

overall, the quality was not as good as i expected. the scale of the models are off (way too big). the plot couldn¡¯t move me much simply because of the not very well thought story delivery. ¡°i will just hide everything from you and reveal them one by one¡± rather than leaving ambiguous traces pointing to many different possibilities (though the ending is pretty good). the volumes of different characters speaking sound different to me...but i do like the stereo sounding. i personally do not enjoy the protagonist. the in-game op ed movies are pretty cool to watch. the game has both the best voice actors and some bad ones (especially the protagonist).

"with the recent patch which added checkpoints, i'm changing my review to positive.

boneworks is a complete and refreshing game, but not perfect. the story is decent (so far) and the physical interactions are gratifying when they work. you have to move the way the game wants you to move, and it can sometimes feel like a hinderance. the guns handle nicely and melee weapons are decent enough but i often times find my hands getting stuck on things, and some motions, like mounting ledges and jumping, are extremely awkward. i also feel that the weapons arsenal could use some expansion (no revolvers?! no shotguns?!)

level design is decent but amateur at times. i got stuck at the first locked door in ""streets"" because i couldn't find the key. **spoiler** it's in a random box in a stack of 20 boxes in the corner of the map with no audio or visual cues to go over there and break boxes. edit: so ive been told there is a sign with a key icon above the boxes. i still think this couldve been handled better. i am generally good at puzzle solving and dont get stuck in games. i've only had one minor sticking point since then but i can't say i've been blown away by the level design.

boneworks will go down as a landmark vr game. despite some issues, slz has taken some risks and elevated the level of interaction we can expect in a vr game.",1579294573,3,0,720113

"i liked the sound baths the best, even though the audio was staticky and distorted at times. the static 360 degree photo used for the environment was really underwhelming considering they expect you to pay $9.99 a month to access them. you really might as well just look for 360 degree video mediations on youtube for free. 

i understand that they have instructors recoding new meditations daily and they certainly deserve to be paid for that work, but someone like myself on a budget really can not justify spending $10 a month for something that i can get for free elsewhere. quality needs to improve drastically before i can wholeheartedly recommend this app to others. 

i will say that i loved each of the instructors i had classes with. everyone seems to genuinely care about their practice and they just seem like really nice people overall. that alone makes me want to support this app, and it¡¯s the reason i couldn¡¯t bring myself to give this app fewer than 3 stars. 

i know this app is completely new and this is really early on in their journey, so i¡¯m hoping they will make the improvements necessary to bring me back. for now, i¡¯m going to continue meditating in the other apps i have been using before this one. i¡¯ll check back in a few weeks or so and see if anything has changed, and i¡¯ll update my review when i do. :)

"for $10 this is worth it even if not on sale
comparable to dead effect 2 and az sunshine minus 2-handed weapon stabilizing mechanics
good gun feel, had a little lag in co op but that may have been connection related
the pace and difficulty of this game is way more terrifying than other zombie wave shooters ive played and the perk / weapon upgrade system makes it very replayable.
enemies are also varied beyond just basic zombies and the boss fights are hard
its definitely arcadey with pickups bonuses combos etc but if thats your thing then this should be in your library

*the one thing i will say is odd / could be improved is the ""smooth snap turning"" option --- if you're going to go that far just give us analog smooth turning plz! but if you have a good roomscale setup it doesn't matter.

the ""ghost"" kayakers you play against crack me up, kinda silly, but an interesting goal to work towards...
although there's really no need for any of that, just sitting in the thing going down a river is amazing.

objects have the correct amount of weight behind them, menus are clean and dont get in the way of anything, there isnt even much of a hud at all
this game is like a giant physics tech demo that also happens to be a game and is like 8-10 hours long depending on how long puzzles take you and how much you explore

and even after you've beaten the main story, the game has replayablity with both an arena mode and sandbox mode to mess around in

only 4 criticisms: lack of left handed mode, im not left handed but i have friends that are not able to play this atm
wmr support is currently broken, but devs have already commented on it and are rushing to path that
vive wand control scheme is bleh
i personally wish there was a ""auto-sprint"" option, kinda annoying to constantly double click the joystick to sprint, maybe even include a ""sprint when joystick is pushed to its limit"" option

for index users, its currently like a 9/10 or even 10/10

nachdem es erhebliche kritik an der fr¡§1hen ea-version gab, hat das studio einen grundlegenden patch ver?ffentlicht, der das gameplay des spiels verbessert und jede menge bugs, wenn auch nicht alle, entfernt hat. 

flock of the low god vr ist ein wirklich furchterregendes horrorgame. ich mag das genre eh nicht besonders gern, in flat ist es mir zu l?cherlich und in vr das genaue gegenteil, ich spiele ?u?erst ungern reine horrorspiele. dieses ist da keine ausnahme und ?begeistert?¡ã mich schon durch die d¡§1stere atmosph?re und den typischen sound. 

wir sind also in der welt von malum, genauer gesagt sind wir in der polizeistation von lanford.  im film malum hei?t es: ""auf der suche nach den mysteri?sen umst?nden des todes ihres vaters wird die neu ernannte polizistin jessica loren zur letzten schicht in einer stillgelegten polizeistation eingeteilt, in der jahre zuvor eine ber¡§1chtigte b?sartige sekte ihr ende fand. als einzige beamtin auf dem revier wird sie bald von erschreckenden paranormalen ereignissen heimgesucht und auf eine reise mitgenommen, auf der sie die schockierende wahrheit hinter der verstrickung ihrer familie mit einem verr¡§1ckten sektenf¡§1hrer erf?hrt.?¡ã und genau das ist auch die geschichte in flock of the low god.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3149849566
wir laufen als jessica per freier bewegung durch die flure der polizeistation, im men¡§1 k?nnen wir lediglich den snapturn ein- bzw. ausschalten. es gibt bisher keine weiteren anpassungen noch grafikeinstellungen. w?hrend wir laufen k?nnen wir den stick dr¡§1cken und kurzzeitig rennen. interaktionen mit gegenst?nden funktionieren alle per gripfunktion. die steuerung ist solide, braucht aber noch mehr einstellungsm?glichkeiten im komfortbereich. 
ein gro?es manko ist (zeitpunkt des test), dass es keine m?glichkeit gibt, auf linksh?ndersteuerung umzustellen. wir k?nnen zwar die waffe mit der linken hand ziehen, aber nicht das magazin auswerfen. zudem ist es sehr umst?ndlich ¡§1ber kreuz greifen zu m¡§1ssen.   
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3149849115
die grafik in flock of the low god ist ebenso solide. die polizeistation sieht auf den ersten blick sehr gut aus, aber die meisten texturen sind leider nicht sehr hoch aufgel?st. es scheint mir, als ob das spiel den mobilemarkt im hinterkopf hat. durch die allgemeine dunkelheit in einem solchen horrorspiel, f?llt das aber nicht sehr ins gewicht. und dunkel ist das spiel leider auch an manchen stellen zu sehr, so dass man objekte leicht ¡§1bersieht.
zudem sind mir einige grafikfehler aufgefallen.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3149849832
den kultisten denen ich begegnet bin sind leider noch ein bisschen stockelig auf den beinen. angst und schrecken verleiht das spiel bisher eher durch die durchaus gruselige atmosph?re getragen durch dunkelheit und sound, aber das ordentlich.

die englische vertonung ist durchaus gelungen und die einblendungen aus dem film als videofilme sind eine tolle idee und verst?rken die bedrohliche kulisse ebenso. allerdings gibt es bisher keine untertitel in einer anderen sprache und die englischen werden scheinbar nur sporadisch eingeblendet. die englischen sprecher sind zudem relativ schwer verst?ndlich, da sie teilweise mit harten akzenten sprechen. 

aber alles in allem hat mir die kurze zeit, die ich in flock of the low god verbracht habe ordentlich angst gemacht und ich habe eigentlich nichts vermisst. ein horror-t(r)ip f¡§1r alle genreliebhaber, mutigen polizistinen und nervenkitzelfans.

interessante info am rande. die produktionsfirma des films, kann sich vorstellen dass toprightcorner zuk¡§1nftig mehr ihrer horrorfilme in die virtuelle realit?t ¡§1bertr?gt, wenn das mal keine guten nachrichten f¡§1r alle gruselfans sind.

[u]english:[/u]
flock of the low god, a vr horror game that was heavily inspired by the horror movie malum. top right corner brings us malum in vr, so to speak.

has top right corner succeeded in bringing the horror movie to vr? people have potential, veterans are certainly still familiar with belko vr.

flock of the low god vr is a truly terrifying horror game. i don't particularly like the genre anyway, in flat, it's too ridiculous for me and in vr the exact opposite, i extremely dislike playing pure horror games. this one is no exception and ""thrills"" me with its dark atmosphere and typical sound. 

so we're in the world of malum, or to be more precise, we're in the lanford police station.  the movie malum says: ""searching for the mysterious circumstances of her father's death, newly appointed police officer jessica loren is assigned to the final shift at a decommissioned police station where a notoriously vicious cult met its end years earlier. as the only officer at the station, she is soon haunted by terrifying paranormal events and taken on a journey where she learns the shocking truth behind her family's involvement with a crazed cult leader."" and that's exactly the story in flock of the low god.

as jessica, we run through the corridors of the police station using free movement and can only switch the snapturn on or off in the menu. there are no further adjustments or graphic settings. while we are running, we can press the stick and run for a short time. interactions with objects all work via the grip function. the controls are solid, but need more adjustment options in the comfort area. 
one major shortcoming at the time of my test is that there is no option to switch to left-handed control. we can draw the gun with our left hand, but not eject the magazine. it is also very awkward to have to cross-grip.   

the graphics in flock of the low god are just as solid. the police station looks very good at first glance, but unfortunately most of the textures are not very high resolution. it seems to me that the game has the mobile market in mind. however, due to the general darkness in a horror game like this, this is not very noticeable. and unfortunately the game is also too dark in some places, making it easy to overlook objects.
i also noticed a few graphical errors. for example, tutorial instructions were only displayed on one eye and were only represented by pink placeholders.

unfortunately, the cultists i encountered are still a little slow on their feet. so far, the game has been more frightening and scary due to the creepy atmosphere created by the darkness and sound.
the english soundtrack is very well done and the overlays from the movie as video films
are a great idea and also reinforce the menacing backdrop. however, there are no subtitles in any other language yet and the english ones are apparently only shown sporadically. the english speakers are also relatively difficult to understand, as they sometimes speak with harsh accents. 

but all in all, the short time i spent in flock of the low god really scared me and i didn't really miss anything. a horror t(r)ip for all genre lovers, brave policewomen and thrill-seekers.
interesting side note. the film's production company can imagine toprightcorner transferring more of its horror films to virtual reality in the future, if that's not good news for all horror fans.",1706538683,0,,157122582

We're so sorry the download issues you're experiencing - there was a bug with the Nougat download. We uploaded a fix, so that it's compatible with the update on Samsung. If the experience crashes on startup, please uninstall and reinstall the app.

"i must say was hesitant in purchasing as surely can't be that realistic to the real thing. took note of the refund policy then downloaded. well no point in worrying about that as i absolutely love it with many options of play available with some good mini games to play.

i don't get time to play golf for real lately but if you like golf or not this is perfect especially multiplayer with friends as it is like being out on the course with some good banter. is a nice little fitness game keeping me flexible and mobile just need to work out a way to hold the controller so its more like holding  a club

to make it more realistic it would be nice to get some different options such as different balls and be able to place the ball on the tee or make the drop using your hand holding the ball. i would like the option of taking my club out of a golf bag too. 

this game has so much potential i can't wait for updates and more courses. just wish i had more time to play. (dang kids)  great work people keep it up.",1664532540,5,"Hello Shifty2463,

Thanks for your review and your rating. We are happy you are enjoying the game. ??

There are several adapters to turn your Oculus controller into something pretty similar to a golf club. On our side, we are in touch with the main manufacturers in order to include compatibility. 

The rest of your suggestions are already on the desk of our design team. Let`s see what they can do.

Warmest greetings to you and your kids!

                     unfortunately this game doesn't work on quest 2 with either virtual desktop or link.

on both when you get to the ""swap to grip tool"" section right at the start it just stops there and progression is impossible despite having switched to the grip tool.

i'd read that the controls were awkward but i never expected them to be utterly useless from the get go.                  ",1614567600,1,,476

"this was my first vr game, and i'm not going to lie, after a while i got a bit bored of this game after discovering other vr titles.

however the new versus mode has brought me back and it's a lot of fun. needs leaderboards though to make it perfect.

unable to play arena mode as i don't have 10x10 space but i don't know why they don't allow people without a 10x10 space to use the joystick? ah well. the new versus mode is good enough.

ignore the people who gives this game 1 star because they cant play the arena mode. i can't , and sure i'm disappointed, but to give this 1 star because of it is a bit over the top!

please introduce leaderboards for the versus mode!!

"nothing like the other series so far... i enjoyed the other games in the series but i am not sure about this 1..lots of spiders.... and lots of waiting. the elevator in the beginning you might even fall asleep waiting to reach the top.

neurosa primal ritual is a decent looking game graphically and storywise, however its boring gameplay and crippling bugs including some game breaking issues make it near impossible to enjoy playing. you can almost guarantee your save will be broken when trying to reload. you are going to have to complete this game all in one session if possible, the save/load feature was probably not even tested and i assure you its without a doubt broken.

other bugs include the shooter bugs dead bodies still crawling around, the red cube going missing, making progression impossible. sometimes the spiders jump at you after you kill them for 1 last bite to eat. i really wish the developer didn't abandon this one because the other neurosa games actually were playable. one time i lost the ability to move after a cutscene. one time i got stuck in an obelisk. other times my saves when inserted into the machine to load a game, it just didn't light up at all. this game i challenge any new person to the game to try and complete it on your first or second attempt. you have to work around the bugs in the game and hope you don't get a bad one during your run in order to reach the end so i challenge anyone unfamiliar with it to try. i am dissatisfied with the final release of the game. the developer was meant to release an update addressing a fix to many of these issues but there have been no fixes as of yet.",1702355512,0,,153421410

"i'm an artist familiar with 3d modeling and vr programming. overall i think this is a good worthwhile program for people looking to make art in vr, but there are a couple things i think could be better!

first off, there was not much of a tutorial in the beginning, and while i was able to play around and figure things out, it took me a while to understand zooming and moving around my sculpture. i think it would be really beneficial to have a more in depth tutorial at the beginning, even if it covers some things that are pretty intuitive. 

secondly, i wish all of the objects had scalable dimensions, like the rectangle and cylinder, as well as a coordinate axis inside. this would help with the range of shapes that can be created, as well as their more precise placement. (the addition of a cone or pyramid option would also be very useful.)

and lastly, i would like to know the memory usage and storage space required while the program is running. and maybe it would also benefit from an auto save feature. i got 30 minutes into and in-depth sculpture and crashed out unexpectedly, losing all my work. 

great program as there are very few even like it, but i can see where it could be better! hopefully, with future updates, this program can be the staple of it's kind!",1528255414,5, ,33900

for the competitive players out there, it's a great way to challenge your mates, and then see them spend hours to try and beat your times... priceless ?? (i know because i've spent hours trying to beat their times!)

one only request i have for the devs, is to please, pretty please post an update about how score is calculated, including flow score. for example, i improved my time on a track by almost 20 seconds, and beat my mate's time, yet my score did not improve at all (i did not beat my mate's score). searched online and saw no one actually knows how exactly those scores are calculated. we need to know to improve competitiveness!!!!

i'm not even a big rts guy, but being the commander and using your hands to place structures and units feels very natural, and gives you a feeling of power.  then you control one of the soldiers and get your hands dirty!  whether you're sniping, using an assault rifle, blowing up a tank with an rpg, or mowing down a horde of enemies with a mounted mg, you feel like a ba.  the shooting is super responsive and the reload mechanics (which are unique for each weapon) are just perfect.  in short, both controlling and being a soldier is fun and addicting!

oh, but wait, they just updated the game to 0.9 with a new mode called overwatch!  did you love sniping so much in the default mode that you wish you could just snipe all day?  well now you can!  choose between the bolt-action and automatic sniper rifles and provide cover for your squad of 6 soldiers, who are being swarmed by enemies!  you really [b]feel[/b] like a sniper, sitting up in your tower and picking off soldiers from hundreds of yards away.  again, extremely fun and addicting!

"half life 2 has been in my top 3 games of all time since its release. the atmosphere in that game is out of this world: the audio, the fully realized alien ecosystem, the look and feel of combine tech... it was a universe of sights and sounds i'll never forget, and in my opinion it reaches to the level of great sci-fi. what's more, the gameplay matched it: always smooth and polished, yet introducing genuinely innovative concepts, like the gravity gun.

like everyone else, i've been pining for more for over a decade, and when alyx was announced, i was cautiously optimistic. i'm happy to say that alyx is a full-fledged return to that same universe i love so much. in fact, it's more than that, as it clearly benefits from valve's additional experience and talent.

valve is the only western developer in my top 3 games list. the others are japanese; i have a tremendous respect for the way in which japanese developers craft their products. valve games reach a similar level of polish and cohesiveness. and that is why it feels like a real treat to see the potential of vr realized to such an extent by this developer.

from the start, every aspect of the experience of half life alyx feels well-crafted, well-presented, and well-thought out from a gameplay point of view. the environments are beautiful and unbelievably detailed. the sense of immersion is brilliant. the gunplay is utterly addictive. everything  i know and love from half life is here, but now, the world feels so much more alive; it is as though i can feel the presence of new, enthusiastic valve developers adding their designs, their gameplay ideas, and their voices. and there were a few moments where i literally stood slack-jawed, admiring the scenery, or some incredible detail in the world: i won't soon forget holding up a dead headcrab to a lamp, and seeing subsurface scattering of light through its skin, revealing a network of veins.

i happily give this game my highest recommendation. having said that, there were a few off notes in the experience; this was partly because i had to dust off my vr setup and get reacquainted with it, and partly because i was using a non-standard audio setup. i experienced a host of bugs and freezes during my first few days, but most of my friends didn't have any issues at all. ultimately, my conclusion is that vr is still a somewhat clunkier technology than the mature, honed experience of flatscreen gaming. but because vr offers the opportunity for such genuinely new experiences and types of gameplay, i am happy to forgive the rough edges, and in half life alyx, vr now has a killer app that is mature enough to stand on its own merits, as opposed to a vr demo or novelty.",1585390921,0,0,552988

"tactical assault vr, i will start off with some good points because its always better to hear the good news before the bad news. customization, huge plus, being able to move your pouches to where you like, is super awesome and would wish most games would follow that mindset, however! first-person body rendering- absolutely not! i hate having to fight my in-game body as well as my real life body for my gear in critical timing situations! you would think placeing a pouch on my hip so i'd have a physical reference point to quickly grab something right?! no it fucking eats my gear so i'm trying to shove my hand into my in-game body as well as contort my real life body to get it while at the same time not get shot by the in-consistant ai and also god forbid you drop something on the floor the game will laugh at you as it will screw up the tracking and start pulling gear off your guy because its ""trying to help"". it just makes the game super un-playable unless i go in with the thought of just fucking around and not trying to win at the game. just like what the fuck!? and yes, i know, you just had the game released, i should be ""gentle and fair"" when honestly, i'm sick of dev's not proof checking their games before releasing it, remember when you had to return your game back to blockbuster or game-stop for the update patches? i sure as fuck don't. i did buy this game while steam had a sale, however, i still cant swallow the $12 price tag this game sold me on this level of work that still needs to be polished, like alot.... i only got to play for about 20-mins or so before i called it quits because of the issue, i never got to do multiplayer because of lack of players on at the time so no fault to the dev's there, but the single-player is what i was hoping would be enough to get me to drag my friends in this game and have them suffer with me however its still greatly un-playable. so that being said ill ask for a refund and keep an eye out for this game and hope that it shows major improvements over the next few days and then ill buy the game for full price and eat my words on this review (although, im betting the devs wont it will be years before the work is corrected and by then ill have moved on from this game entirely) 1/5 stars",1679928991,0,,135548872
"okay stress level zero.

i don't know if you read reviews, but i imagine you do.  considering the work you put into this baby, i have a chance to reach you and talk to another version of me somewhere with this review.  i have been gaming all my life and this experience is truly what i imagined future gaming to be like. 

some context on who i am: i am techy, love modding, and a very frugal gamer.  however, this is the first game i have paid full price for and will gladly support your future projects.  following boneworks, hl alyx, and wanting to take the plunge into skyrimvr; i left my thrifty ways behind and got an index and upgraded my old gtx 680 to a 2060 super.  if talking to another version of me, i would leave r/patientgamers again in a heartbeat. 

to slz: at the start of your game i watched the dude put on his modded vr headset and i almost started crying.  from a younger version of me: ""thanks for creating the future i wanted.""

edit:
the style, humor, art, physics... everything feels so right.  i broke a cup with a hammer, then threw the hammer into the air, it bounces off the wall and the clawed end sticks into a globe on the table.  i grab the crowbar and notice that if i hold it with a full grip it stays tight.  if i only use my pointer and thumb it literally wobbles and slides in my hand as if i don't have the same strength when holding it.  the physics are so spot on it is mind melting. 

awe.  just awe.  i was climbing the pyramid at the heavy objects tutorial by hand and my weight tipped, then pulled the top block down on myself. i have never felt so satisfied with a game's immersion.

"""the utility room"" is an experimental vr platformer that excels at scale and atmosphere, something only vr can do this well. its short length is counterbalanced by excellent pacing and production design. you feel like an intruder in an alien, unknown dimension you can't possibly comprehend, and there's some moments here i won't forget.

my biggest critique of the game is that you need strong vr legs to not get motion sick. there's a lot of jumping and height platforming, which can be difficult for someone new to vr. unless you're an advanced vr user with a strong stomach, i wouldn't play this.

pros:
- compelling art design, huge scale looks incredible in vr
- bizarre otherworldly vibe unlike anything i've seen
- runs great considering scale


cons:
- very short (<90 mins), expensive for length
- jumping is annoying and inconsistent (and there's a lot of it)
- buggy, especially on index
- collectibles are not very compelling to get",1705271764,0,,155998863

"it is difficult to rate this game properly. if there was an option to ""maybe"" recommend this game, i'd choose that.
the visuals are close to gorgeous. the fps portion feels good. the story has potential if it would be expanded (a lot).
voice acting is good, but the dialogues need polish.

and that's about the positiv stuff.

on the other side, for the current price of 30?, there is simply not enough game here. i did take my time, and still finished in about 7hrs with no real urge to repeat it. enemy diversity is lacking, but considering the very short storyline i guess that's kinda fair, since there wasn't much room to add too many different enemies.
that's another issues, though. you have basically no idea what's going on, get ordered around by a drone controlled by an annoying pilot, have no idea where you came from, where you are going and what you are doing, and suddenly the story is over just when it felt like it was about to finally really take off.
and the climbing mechanic in this game must be the one most infuriating thing i've encountered in a vr-game so far.

so all in all, if you still want to buy this game, that's fair. but i'd recommend to wait for it to be on sale.

at first i was quite sceptical from all the reviews that were talking about how short this game is, but this is a perfect case of quality over quantity, and they delivered quality, with a great style, graphics, music, vocals and humor.

there are a lot of things that i love about this. i'm so glad to see higher budget vr games with lengthy campaigns, voice acting and attention to detail starting to be developed. unfortunately for me, i just can't play this because there's no teleportation and it makes me sick moving around with a stick.

[b]pros[/b]
+ voice acting is great
+ looks good, runs well
+ arms have physics, so you can't swing a melee weapon at super speed
+ you have to wrap your arm in bandage to heal
+ you have to put the melee weapon at the right angle through the zombie's head with enough force to go through the brain, and you have to tug it out too
+ finger tracking is excellent

"vr can be life-changing. 

thanks largely to this game i have improved stamina, flexibilty, renewed my appreciation of various music genres, and acquired some dance moves beyond raptor arms.

i'm still fatter, older, and achier than i'd like, but i can occasionally escape to tron mode, where popping bubbles is all.


for prospective purchasers - anyone with at least two arms can enjoy this game at the lower levels, but the simpler algorithm can lead to a perceived lack of on-beat orbiness.

the 'harder' and 'elite' levels match up much better. at these levels only tracks using novelties like a sudden stop/start or reverse samples can become frustrating. pretty much anything else with a defined beat will be fun. 

i prefer 'harder', which makes you swing your pants, and everything else, for the activity score. elite provides activity points by upping the orbage and pattern diffuculty a bit, often becoming an all-arm twitch-fest. different strokes, i guess. 


as far as improvements - of course we can hope for more of everything - modes/backgrounds etc., but it's a fantastic, well-balanced game as it stands, and i'd rather the dev put his time and experience into audioshield 2, with a view to the capabilities of next-gen vr hardware.

the game is a wave shooter game where you stay in one spot in the same map the entire game, the best way i can describe this game is that its a lot like those zombie rail shooters you would find in arcades that you would shoot at the screen with a fake gun to control and would usually cost 2 dollars to play. the game is incredibly simplistic and flawed, which sucks because i think this honestly has some potential to actually be good. i would probably be willing to spend money on it if they worked on it some more. the shotgun has pathetically short range, the pistol is weak and punching is overpowered. zombies only take damage from headshots so aiming is critical, unfortunately the game itself is very dark (probably to make creating textures easier for the developers) and its hard to distinguish the sights of your guns from what youre shooting at, making aiming more difficult than it should be.
i want to say more about this but the game is of such small scale that theres not much to talk about, its just kinda forgettable overall. if you want to play a good zombie shooting game i would recommend the walking dead: saints and sinners",1601697287,2,1,402305

i own both the steam & quest version of this game and needless to say the two have major differences and the standalone quest version although still alot of fun and scary and even more freedom and mobile i cannot lie the graphics are toned down the lowest they could go and some but the game still runs pretty good the prolog though missing alot of feel compared to the pc version was still thrilling i wouldn't necessarily give $40 for this game unless you're a fan of the walking dead or just want an open world shooter game to kinda utilize your device definitely one of the best games you could currently buy but make no mistake its a workout and a rollercoaster of emotions when you gotta hand reload your bullets in your pistol individually while being chased by a growing herd of walkers i wouldn't blame anyone for shelving this one for a while after buying it but thats kinda what you want a zombie game to do to you give you fear and anxiety hearing zombies around the corner not exactly knowing which direction they're coming from if they're lurking or maybe just stumbling around and you searching catches their attention storywise the game brings feelings similar to the tt twd choiced based games which is a compliment given that at least to me those games were pretty awesome i haven't finished it yet mainly because i have been having fun in the survivor mode which has multiple maps which is pretty fun giving you options to buy or savage yours supplies for your survival killing walkers gives you points or just surviving waves gives you coins to save up for weapons for the faint hearted but there's also perks you could buy such as making your backpack during the match bigger. overall the game definitely is not perfect but a great videogame none the less my handful of complaints would just be put an atlanta map with more stuff and actual licensed characters but for it being its own thing i do respect it. wish there was some form of multiplayer.,1660081620,5, ,241877

"everyone loves games like beat saber and super hot and they are amazing games. but you also need less physically strenuous games that test your mental strength instead. if you are looking for a top notch puzzle game look no further. this game is worth every penny you pay for it. multiple levels, each just about the right level of challenging. i hope another room vr game is in the works as i will definitely be purchasing it if there is.",1612754614,5, ,132319

loving the npcs with text to speech voices and the gameplay is pretty immersive! shooting feels good and there's many guns to choose from but you really have to conserve your ammunition. the eject magazine button and jump button are swapped for the quest 2 controller but thats a small issue compared to how good the game is. graphics-wise, its about the average quest exclusive game but i think the cacti are real cute! considering its free, i highly recommend you give it a try!

"contractors vr is a pretty good combat game. i like the reloading and specs of the game. i¡¯ll list my pros and cons below.
pros: 
-great weapon designs and customization 
-your able to customize your armor strength and even have a secondary primary 
-every weapon has some good recoil
-in weapon calibration you can choose where your gun is if you have a gun stick for you vr controllers for gun games
-pretty good maps, i mean it¡¯s basic buildings but what can you do when running it on quest eh?
-much more pros i forgot cause i have a bad memory
-multiple weapons and utilities such as drag grenades, claymores, flash grenades, and more

cons:
-either i haven¡¯t figured it out or you just can¡¯t, i can¡¯t find how to customize your vest to place your guns and equipment in different spots for easily reaching weapons
-kinda feels unfair when the people who only use heavy armor and mac 10s kill you when you shoot first
-there¡¯s no tutorial to show you the ropes so i guess i should say something instructions for tutorial: top button is to release your mag on certain guns or return the slide on a pistol. the bottom button is to choose which firing mode you want. for when you rack the slide on a gun press the trigger on the hand your using to rack it and press the grip for grips idk. and some other things i forgot i¡¯m sorry.
-another con is the random buttons that when you press them do something scary to me. if you get scared easily do not press the buttons near the map board or in the cage room next to the map board. they spawn zombies and the other spawns guys with guns that scared the poop out of me and made me take off the headset. please devs make some signs for the buttons cause new people like me are bound to get spooked

"definitely a fun program! i did refund it at first, but i am buying again now. i will say the tracking is a little wonky specifically on the legs, and i'm not sure if this is a universal problem or something i have to adjust. the settings generally are a tad confusing, but with practice i'm sure it's not bad! i plan to be buying slimevr trackers of just the $195 set for feet knees and waist, and i plan to use this with them for mixed tracking and smoothing! overall a really decent program that makes me want actual tracking even more! would absolutely especially recomemnd this to people who already have full body in vr just for the smoothing capabilities! as for just standalone, it's a little buggy, but for estimation tracking standards it is amazing.

edit! i've used this app for about seven or eight hours and it was amazing! the sitting down animation is a little wonky, but i am plus sized so that may be just due to that - not discouraging at all however! the tracking, especially with the hip movement and chest rotation are so nice.i plan to buy just the lower set of slimevr trackers to go with this with mixed tracking, it's so good with filling in the gaps or so i've seen! will update again when these trackers are recieved!",1732162606,0,,179477821

this wouldnt be such a big deal, however the devs didn't give any advanced notice that they would be doing this, and from the way things are looking i don't think the pcvr onward experience will ever be as good as it once was. they also aren't allowing any refunds, even me who you can see has very little time in game. this some bait and switch shit, dont get scammed like i did. keep your money and buy a much better game such as pavlov or contractors.

"we need more content, a campaign, more missions, more aircraft. fighters work beautifully, helicopters work beautifully. we need moreeeeeee. thus i demand thee boundless dynamics create thee content for me.

legit tho this could be a direct competitor to dcs created by eagle dynamics. if they could add dynamic campaigns along with larger multiplayer support, this game would be ground breaking in the vr world and possibly even just normal gaming world. sure, you can use your vr headset in dcs. but you still need your mouse to select keys on the console, and you need a joystick and throttle to even enjoy it. but this game nails it all in full vr without any additional hardware required. the t-55 update was pretty cool, but id rather see an f-14 update, which in my head i imagine the t-55 might be the gateway for them to test out 2 seater aircraft and see if it is a viable option. while i hate to see them selling additional aircraft seperately like the ah-94 and the t-55 i can understand it. but imagine a massive multiplayer (or co-op, which i would honestly prefer) dynamic campaign with ai that are smart enough to launch response flights to an aircraft entering the airspace, and you got 2 dudes running an a-10 gun run on target and 2 or 3 f-45as doing cover on incoming fighters.",1680840395,0,,136248750

"just tested it and i have to say its a really fun game.... kinda like getting over it, but instead of only having mental torture you have mental and physical torture!!

i saw the creators post about their new game on a vr forum and thought i should give it a try.
the maps are really fun, though i have only managed to reach to the 3rd ""wall"" (each level section is kinda a new wall).

the physics are pretty reliable for an indie game i guess but they still have their ""happy little accidents"" sometimes, which i actually believe is a good and bad thing. it spices up the gameplay and creates tension because it creates a touch of uncertainty, but a really bad physics glitch might mess up your run lol.

all in all a game with great potential and since its a vr title id say 7 euros are a fair price as of right now. i really hope the developer continues working on more levels and maybe some map design... a workshop option would be really good aswell if this game manages to take of and build a community around it.

"after installing virk, higgs, planck, and their dependencies, this game is one of the best i've ever played.  first, i strap on some 5 lb ankle weights (why in a second), then i start up vrocker and configure it (found on steam and allows you to naturally move), then i start up the game through the sksevr file, and finally enter the game.  you can do all of this from inside the headset, by the way, using the virtual desktop (aside from the ankle weights).  time from initial setup to being in the game takes less than five minutes for me at this point.

tip: you'll want to copy the sksevr.exe file to your desktop (i prefer directly on the taskbar, as it's right there).  then just start the virtual desktop from inside the headset, click on the .exe file, and you're in the game!

i also have several texture and weather mods installed: onyx vr weathers, hd skyrim overhaul, and noble skyrim.  yeah, hdso and ns overlap a lot, but it doesn't hurt to have them both and they make the game look fantastic and very real.  seriously, the game looks like shit without texture mods installed to make it look like skyrim se.  for some reason, they decided to use skyrim le as the base for vr, and it looks really bad.

now, the game.  rule number one: avoid close combat with spiders.  avoid close combat with spiders.  they are horrifying in vr and always make me run in the opposite direction (literally with vrocker active).  fortunately, if you're a decent shot with a bow (and you'll become one, trust me), they can be easily dispatched from a distance.  on the other hand, physical combat is really fun with virk, higgs, and planck installed, and i find myself reaching for my sword more than my bow these days.  encountering bandits on the road now feels like a genuine threat, especially at a low level.

with mods (and a few outside extras listed above), skyrim vr is simply incredible.  if only i could import my skyrim le save file to it (never played special edition).",1659056856,0,,119674432

"(disclaimer: this isn't my final review on the game, just my thoughts/notes so far into it, i'm currently sick so i can't play it as of now but i'm too excited to finish the game before giving feedback i'm loving this game so much)

when i saw this game had a vr version i was absolutely amazed by how well it looked on the trailer, the performance is pretty clean but some bugs are definitely present like the lighting being unbalanced (super dark in one area when another part of the same room is lit normally) also when you respawn after dying there's a chance the game will make the lighting immensely reduced like having tunnel vision. (only able to see what your flashlight is pointing at, everything else being pitch black)

other than those issues the game overall is pretty good so far, i just have the revolver and shotgun right now.
some might find the gunplay tedious but i think it's actually pretty fun. loading ammo with your mouth into your weapons is pretty immersive and gives me dopamine every time i do it.

of course there's definitely some qol things needed but those will come in time i'm sure, i know it sounds silly but a new game plus would be awesome if it's not a thing yet.

(i finished the original game so long ago i forgot the story, but hearing the music and cynte's voice again is amazing, {he's so hot- what?} i legit love these kinds of games, hope to see it grow, there's alot of possibilities with this game<3 maybe a rouge-like mode?, boss rush?, horde? ok i'll stop haha)",1711058212,0,,161097492

"highly recommend for any vr user and its definitely worth the price and the upgrade from any free software that tries to fill the same function. windows are all axis tiltable and repositionable in space. you can easily change the: distance, size, opacity, curve, which hand it is locking to (or even your head). having windows lock to your hands that only show up if your hand is at the correct rotation, is close enough to your face, and you are looking directly at it (all of these are customizable tolerances and can be disabled) means that windows will never pop up and break you immersion in game and you don't have to open the full overlay, this is amazing for things like changing playlists in spotify, controlling audiobooks that don't use media controls, watching youtube videos but not needing the actual video for the entire video, checking a performance overlay. the wristwatch is amazing too, shows controller and tracker battery (index), has media controls, shows fps and other hardware usage stats, and has the time so you don't get lost in a play session. the settings menu is a little bit janky and the software overall has its quirks but they are easy to live with and don't really bother you after a while.

the only areas i would like to see some improvement on is: the layout of the windows list, saving and loading layouts is confusing and too easy to delete/overwrite as it doesn't really have a definitive ""save"" or ""load"" button, switching the view to other windows is a really long list with lots of items that shouldn't be on there and some that should but aren't it might be easier as a grid and some improved filtering/detection would be nice (also maybe a frequents or resents), i still don't know how to bring back the default keyboard after switching to a community made one on the workshop.

"there are no premade things in this game.

every single thing you ever see was made by players and that works extremely well in vr, because with your hands you can shape very easily compared to a mouse or a controller.

the scripting is actually quite powerful and people have made anything from animated glowing butterflies to complex stuff like a cannon that has to be loaded with gunpowder first before firing, or a fully animated gun that looks like a paid asset from the unity store (but it was built with the ingame tools! by players! without living vr!)

even if you're not the creative guy, join this just to hang out, collect stuff and explore and maybe you'll find your inspiration to make amazing things with the help of other guys.

if you enjoy the pacing of saints and sinners, you'll appreciate the gameplay in requisition vr. but understand, it's not as polished, sophisticated or as large; this is a title made by a small team and not a big studio. visually very good and everything moves smoothly, the controls are pretty tight. sometimes the collision detection striking the zombies isn't perfect, but mostly fine.

everything can be played single player or mp. the main game composes of story-based levels, where you need to complete a number of tasks. so you need to explore the map and find the resources etc. there's plenty of stuff to play with, making unique weapons by combining objects. also building defences by boarding up doorways and windows, and making traps and bombs.
also includes a wave based horde mode.

the devs have been very active releasing updates frequently which is great to see they are invested in improving and expanding the game. it's fair to say the game does need some fine-tuning to reach it's full potential, but i'm enjoying the game so far. a game that hardcore zombie fans will enjoy more than casual vr gamers i would say.",1669546644,0,,127195111

"as others have mentioned, this is a really cool shuttle landing simulator. i have done the liftoff once which is cool, but there are other aspects of the game which i have not looked at yet due to just enjoying trying to improve my landings. i'm writing a review to tell people to watch some youtube videos showing how to land a space shuttle first, before attempting the sim - it'll make so much more sense. here is the one i watched which made a bunch of lightbulbs go off for me: https://youtu.be/jb4prvsxkzu you can also watch hud recordings of shuttle landings which help things make sense: https://youtu.be/kkjdr5-i5-s

i do agree that it feels strange to remove the other astronauts during landing, and i would really like it if they were there. also, is there a way to switch off the cockpit lights during night landings? it feels like all the lights wouldn't be on during a real landing due to night blindness? maybe i'm wrong. would love to see any updates that come to this simulation!",1604373814,5, ,208149
"the camera isn't too good.
there are sections where the camera is fixed, you are forced to look at your character from a weird angle, and from too close/far distance.

the sections where the camera moves continuously on a rail gives me motion sickness and wouldn't qualify as ""comfortable"" for me.

also i tried to take a shortcut in the first level (jumping on a box) and the camera stopped moving forward... i had to control my character from ridiculous distance and of course died. so you have a follow a very specific path, otherwise the camera will stop tracking you.

otherwise the gameplay is okay, but the ""vr"" element doesn't bring any positive value. worse camera control than other platforms, no meaningful use of motion control (gimmicks like fist bump don't count).

doesn't do anything better than what crash bandicoot does on console.
so you are playing more for the ""vr experience"" rather than for the gameplay itself.",1608261814,5,"Hello, thank you for your feedback. Sorry that you encountered some problems.

"huge tip for new players: turn the metronome feature up all the way.  i found that several of the songs were difficult to determine the beat.  the metronome will cause your controller to vibrate to the beat and it helps tremendously.

---update 2---
the new mini-campaign is actually pretty awesome for free content and i'd love to see more like this.  i'd have actually paid $5+ for it, so this would actually be a really solid way to keep pumping out content while still keeping enough revenue flowing in to fund development.

---update---
changing my review to positive.  while i still fully believe that this game needs to support modding in order to survive, the devs have been consistent with their content updates.  and, while the track list is still very limited compared to other rhythm games, that (and the overall quality of each map) is enough for me to feel safe in recommending without worrying that support for the game will drop off.  that said, there's no way they will be able to keep up with free content updates.  at some point sales of the game won't provide enough support for further development and we'll be left with whatever the final set list is.  devs, if you're listening, please please please work on mod support.


---original review---

this is one of those times that i wish steam had some sort of middle rating option.  despite my playtime, i still can't recommend the game.  pistol whip is a super fun game, don't get me wrong.  the music in the game is catchy, the gameplay is a blast, and it gives you a decent workout.  there's just one huge problem: lack of content.  

i was able to get through the entire song list in under an hour.  and while the increased difficulties give a little more replay, it's still just be the same small handful of songs over and over again.  this wouldn't be a problem if the game supported modding, but it doesn't.  at the moment, custom songs aren't a thing for this game.  you can import your music through ""hacky"" means, but it only changes the audio and not the enemies or world.  once this game fully supports modding and custom songs, i'd absolutely highly recommend.  but, at the moment, i just can't say its worth the price when other vr rhythm games are out there that fully support modding at either the same or only slightly higher in price.  its actually baffling that they still don't support custom maps/songs yet.  

if this game goes on sale, then i'd say pick it up.  for now i'm mostly using it for some light, enjoyable exercise rather than coming back over and over purely for fun like i do with beat saber.",1588216758,3,0,378075
"the game itself is great , but there is no skill based matchmaking. so i got the game yesterday and i was lvl 1 afcourse, and i already played against people that are lvl 50. so it¡¯s a very hard game for me, that¡¯s why i dont really like playing it",1620962614,5, ,210137

"early impressions based on playing about 5 or 6 songs.

this game is legit. it plays like a good hybrid between beat saber and airtone. the majority of the gameplay feels like airtone in that you have to place your hands in the way of the gems that come at you, and it plays like beat saber in that there are also special gems that require you to swing your arm in specific directions to hit them correctly and there are walls that get you moving and ducking around the play space.

there are only 10 songs at the moment but they're all licensed (lady gaga, zedd, benny benassi, etc) and they're all choreographed by the programmer's wife who is a dancer. and that's what really sets it apart from beat saber imo. whereas beat saber maps have to kind of trick you in to approximating dance choreography, these maps are built specifically to choreographed dances (there's even a rez like figure you can toggle on or off that shows you the moves while you're playing). this gives the game a different feel that makes it worth having alongside bs.

they also give you the option of doing a quick version of the song or doing the full version which would come in handy for parties (a decent amount of the songs approach 5 or more minutes). 10 more songs are supposed to be added for free before it comes out of early access but i'm interested to see what the custom scene looks like when they get the promised custom song editor out.

graphically it's pretty impressive with kind of a synthwave 90s trapper keeper vibe going on that extends to the varied backgrounds that change pretty frequently and drastically over the course of a song. one minute you're looking at lasers fly by,  the next you're in a surreal desert. pretty cool.

the game overall is pretty polished for an early access title too. menus are handled really well, there are a decent amount of options out of the gate, and the overall package feels very professional.

difficulty is pretty up there. i've only played a few songs on beginner and a few on regular and regular is no joke so there's lots of room for challenge in the game (for context, i can comfortably play beat saber songs on expert). i kind of wonder if beginner will be a little too hard for casual players though. the game could probably use a difficulty level easier than that.

besides that, my only issues with the game at the moment are that there aren't that many songs at the moment (10), and that i wish you could change the colors of the gems that fly at you. a large part of the difficulty for me at the moment is wrapping my head around which color is which hand after playing so much beat saber (there is an option to flip colors in the menu).

other than that, the game is great and i imagine will only get better in time when they add more songs, add the custom song editor, and possibly add new modes.",1571958761,3,0,727095

"4.5/5 - it¡¯s a great game and is a lot of fun. it is  only the ¡°winning play¡± arcade style where you have 2 minutes to score that winning touchdown(s). only offense which is fine and it does feel very good to throw a bomb and score in the last seconds. a few things i think could be improved is first off my skills, but i also felt like there were times the ball would maybe just fall or not release? not sure if i was taking to much time and getting sacked or it more so felt that it kind of was losing some of my tracking since i¡¯d be throwing off to the side like i normally would, resulting in a hilariously bad throw. i think tho i¡¯f i slow it down and perfect my ¡°form¡± i can mitigate it happening majority of the time. defiently a fun pick up and play game",1579231414,5,"Hi DrKotulak!  Thanks for the kind review, as you probably guessed we read them all.  If you're having the ball fall short, it's because your controller has lost tracking.  this can occur in 2 scenarios:  1) the battery is low.  change it!  or 2) If, in the process of winding up your throw, you hold your hand out of view of the Quest's cameras, it can lose precise data for where the controller is.  This affects the calculated throw velocity and angle.  My advice here is, make sure you're not holding your hand behind your head (or out of view of the HMD's side camera) for more than a second.  Usually a normal wind-up and throw is much shorter than this, so it shouldn't be much of an adjustment!  Anyway, hope that helps, thank you again for leaving your feedback, best of luck with the championship and thanks for playing our game!",218517

"arizona sunshine is a virtual reality first-person zombie shooter that takes place in a small canyon area of arizona and it may be one of the most ambitious virtual reality games so far. while it may not be as deep as modern day zombie shooter video games, arizona sunshine more than makes up for it with its incredible immersion and excellent controls. 

arizona sunshine initially boots up with a virtual main menu inside of a trailer. you can walk around this trailer and interact with various objects like tennis balls, cans, and refrigerator doors. the main menu is an old video game console that requires you to pick up video game cartridges and insert them in order to load them. to choose options in the submenus, you need to pick up a little sensor gun and aim it at the screen. the menu looks and works great, and it really helps to sell the vr experience, but can be a bit tedius if you¡¯re trying to test settings and restarting the game frequently. 

now let¡¯s talk a bit about the game¡¯s story campaign. the campaign starts off with you waking up inside a cave in a post-apocalyptic arizona canyon. it isn¡¯t clear who our character is, but he occasionally chimes in with some funny lines and the voice acting is delivered well. after grabbing some weapons and shooting a few zombies, you begin traveling through some small linear canyon paths with tons of abandoned cars and small buildings to loot for extra ammo and weapons. the zombies increase in difficulty as you progress, with some zombies sprinting towards you, and others wearing bulletproof helmets and armor. occasionally, you¡¯ll run into sequences where you need to trigger a horde of zombies to attack you which can be some of the most intense moments in the game, requiring you to position yourself appropriately and put your own real-life ability to aim a gun to the test. the story only takes about 2 hours to complete, but the experience is a lot like those arcade zombie shooter games that are always fun to replay just for the immersive experience, and i expect to replay this game several times. oh and the ending? is freakin badass. 
but if replaying the story campaign doesn¡¯t interest you, there¡¯s always the horde mode which places you in a small arena with limited access to weapons and ammo and an endless horde of zombies split up by short intervals that allow you to catch your breath. 
there¡¯s also a cooperative mode, but since i don¡¯t know anyone else that owns a vr headset, i didn¡¯t get a chance to try this out. you can always play cooperatively with a random player online, but the difficulty scales significantly to accompany another player, making for a much harder experience, so you better hope you¡¯re paired with someone with good aim. 

but while story and extra game modes are nice, the real meat of any virtual reality experience is the gameplay. arizona sunshine has excellent first person shooter gameplay, and various options to satisfy all types of virtual reality players. the game by default offers the ¡°teleporting¡± mechanic for movement, allowing you to simply hold a button and release to go to specific locations nearby, which can help you cross distances without motion sickness, but can be difficult to use in tight situations, especially when a large horde of zombies enter the picture. if you want, you can switch the movement to the touchpad for a more immersive experience, but if you¡¯re prone to motion sickness, you may want to keep this disabled. the motion tracking and aiming works incredibly well with the htc vive and i never felt like i needed to awkwardly adjust my aim to compensate for out-of-sync motion controls like i would with the wii controllers or the playstation move. aiming down the iron sights of guns worked exactly how they should and any time i missed a shot, meaning i had nothing to blame but my own crappy aim. to reload your guns, you need to release the magazine with the touchpad button and then bring the gun to your ammo belt. i did run into a few issues with the reload mechanic. since the buttons for rotating the character are left and right on the touchpad, i found it easy to accidentally drop my magazine on the ground when trying to reposition myself, requiring me to awkwardly fumble around on the ground for my dropped magazine before the zombies get to me. aside from that, the gameplay feels great and makes you feel like a total badass as you akimbo different types of hand guns and alternate between firing them and reloading them like some action movie star. the game features a ton of different weapon types ranging from different calibers of pistols to submachine guns and even frag grenades. i did find the grenades a bit awkward to use, and would often accidentally drop them on the ground as i tried to reach for my holster to grab another gun in intense situations. even when you pull the pin and try throwing the grenades, they don¡¯t seem to go very far, it feels as if you¡¯re throwing a ton of bricks. but the explosion is satisfying when they do work, and watching the zombies explode after you rolled a grenade at their feet is always awesome. 

the game¡¯s headtracking is also excellent and makes the experience all the more immersive. being able to duck down behind cars and aim through windows and peak around corners in doorways shows the awesome potential of virtual reality and this game is an excellent demonstration to show just that. 
the graphics and performance aren¡¯t the best in gaming, but they get the job done and the level of detail on objects and weapons is suburb. environmental detail is lacking and water simulation is pretty basic, and overall, it definitely feels like you¡¯re inside an arcade game. but being able to look around and see massive canyon walls around you isn¡¯t something you can experience even in the best looking triple a games, so i can handle the lower graphical quality. when i tried to boost the graphics in the menu to increase supersampling and shadow quality, i found performance took a nose-dive, even with a gtx 1080ti and i7 6700k processor. so i decided to stick with some recommended settings with a few tweaks here and there to reduce aliasing and i managed to get a pretty stable framerate with some decent visual quality. there¡¯s still some more tweaking to be had here, but i¡¯ll save that for a graphical benchmark video in the future. 
arizona sunshine costs $40 and includes a short story campaign with a cooperative option, and a limited survival mode. the graphics are some of the better graphics on the virtual reality platform, but won¡¯t really blow you away either. but the feeling of lining up the sights on a .45 pistol and blowing zombies heads off and then spinning around to kill 3 more zombies with a mac-10 makes it all worth it and arizona sunshine ends up being completely worth the price of admission. i look forward to booting up this game and blasting some more zombies away and this will likely be one of the lead games i¡¯ll use to demonstrate what this device can do.

"updated:

taking it from a 4 to a 3 star review. developers did get in touch but i think my takes were misunderstood. there are ""contour lines"" that move according to the green slope however they are nowhere near what the actual slope would be, i know, it's a game. but, with the way these greens are 45 acres in size, 4-5-6 putts are a strong reality. going to throttle back my enthusiasm until further updates.

couple critical takes from a very avid golfer. 

1. the par threes shouldn¡¯t be 260-325 yards, make that realistic like 130-200 yards. 
2. putting is horrendous. maybe allow an assist function or easier view of contouring. 
3. allow the length of clubs to adjust in view. currently when i adjust club length it ¡°pushes¡± the view further away but doesn¡¯t affect the viewable length of the club, which is where feel comes from. 

ready to play more!!!",1650662520,5,"Hi, nnswartz,

Thanks for your rating.

Regarding putting,  the new slope display simply uses contour lines, as shown on physical maps. A curve is drawn by joining points on a slope that are at the same level. When the curves are close to each other, the slope is steeper, while when they are far from each other, the slopes are smoother. Also, the higher levels are colored green, while the lower levels are colored brown. If there are no contour lines on a green, it means they are too flat to display lines, although It can be small irregularities on them.

To make a perfect putt, you have to take into account that the ball will tend to acquire a direction perpendicular to the curves that it crosses on its way down a slope.

We have forwarded your other suggestions to our design team, thank you!

Best,

"while the production quality of the game is relatively high, it's very short and badly paced. just after you finish being introduced to the world and it's characters, it's over. this is obviously intended as an opening chapter to a series of games, and it really should be advertised as such, i.e. ""twilight path: episode 1"".

actual playing time was about 1.5-2 hours. the ""puzzles"" are more about figuring out the game controls and mechanics. nothing was any real challenge to solve. if you've played form, you'll see the exact same mechanics reproduced here. my suggestion to the developers is to add more layers to the puzzles. for instance, rather than having the actual solution hidden in glowing lines, perhaps it only reveals a clue, or series of clues which the player must figure out before they know how to solve the puzzle in front of them.

"what as good game this is.

the tension, the buildup, the environment, audio, voice acting, monster design are all top notch.

everything is designed to have you on the edge.

in the game you are in kind of a time loop, where you go to a kinda ""descent horizon"" kinda freighter, where something horrible happened, and now you have to escape.

to do so you need to explore the ship, power the engines, set the coordinates, and so on a few specific rooms.

you move at a slow paced speed because you are supposedly in a heavy suit that doesnt let you run at all, this added with limited ammo, of course increases the tension of any encounter.

each time you do a run, you find some data disks that give you the recipes to build stuff. once the data disk is in the computer it remembers it for all future runs (thats the rougelike part of the description)

aside from that, you also learn things about the behavior of the enemies, how they attack the best way to approach or run away from them, how the infected room work, that eventually make you last longer.

i just finished a complete run, took me 14hrs (~2hrs for my succesful run). i havent gotten all unlocks yet.

im very satisfied with my purchase, id love for cosmodread2 to be announced soon, and id recommend this game for anyone that wants a horror game that doesnt rely on jumpscares to get you nervous.",1621174890,3,1,392671

"this is a vr game based on the rick and morty series. in this game, you basically play as morty's clone, who was created by rick to take on tasks on his behalf. this is like job simulator, another game of owlchemy lab.

there are things to interact with, funny comedic stuffs around and things to experimental with to can entertain you for hours.

the main game itself will take roughly 2 hours to complete (provided you didn't get stuck for long), but you wouldn't see everything that the game has to offer if that's the case. there's a part in the game (which i wouldn't spoil) that offer split paths, and if you want to see everything in that segment you will have to replay that part. in total, you will probably take 3 hours or more to complete for first try.

the game mainly take place in the garage, with some cases where you will head to other places. in the garage, there are 3 fixed teleportation spot, allowing you to shift to where ever you want. if there's something out of your range, you can just summon a mr. meeseeks to take it for you.

"my recomendation of this game is as a stand alone title. if you have played fallout 4 before this, like me, you may not find anything that warrants a replay of the game, despite being in vr. i dont recomend to past players of fallout 4 at the price it is. if i had never played fallout 4 before, i would 85% reccomend playing in vr instead however.

pros to fallout 4 vr
- solid, very enjoyable gameplay
- many hours of gameplay with an ok story
- vr mechanics augment gameplay (much more immersive, very cool!)
- atmosphere is good
- visuals are ok

cons
- vr mode is incomplete, scoped weapons do not work
- i have had crashes initially, not sure from what, their frequency have reduced, save often
- menus are a hassle, particularly splitting large stacks of things like ammo (luckily you can avoid menus mostly with the favourites wheel)
- visuals are crippled by default game settings (enter ""taa off"" an see the difference)
- rift is not supported (but does work :p menus just really really suck!)
- environment gets repetative with the dull and brown colour scheme, the effect of which is amplified by being in vr!
- this is a vr title, and requires standing. most game sessions for me are hours in length and can be tiring
- finally if you have played other vr titles, you may find the vr gameplay immersion breaking compared to them. you cant scrounge through containers with your hands, you cant manually reload your weapon, you cant really interact with anything with your hands without pressing the interact button

overall 
fallout 4 vr is my most played vr title yet. if you have not played fallout 4 and have a headset, despite the shortcomings, you should consider fallout 4 vr since it still has more to offer than many other titles out there in vr. being able to explore a world this size is great and will keep you occupied for many hours.

"       played on an oculus rift s. this game is really well made and is definitely a cardio killer. the main premise is to fight tougher opponents as you progress. this is not a game where you train up stats or progress through a story, it's literally just bouts. the game play is nice and it feels rewarding, to me, when you knock them done after two minutes of none stop power punches, then they get up. the game has a range of difficulties but struggling on normal mode was my cup of tea. as i previously mention, there's no progression. you go from one fight to the next. the game has a small space needed to play, roughly 4x4 feet. the swinging is based on how fast you throw the punch, i haven't been able to cheese fights by throwing light jabs to the face (i have tried). overall i would say this is a good game for getting into exercise, helps with cardio, and it feels rewarding after you spend 6 minutes huffing and puffing throwing your arms around. 
       in my final conclusion i must say that this game is short and the replay ability is limited. i do enjoy this game for the fun i have had. i would only suggest this game if you are looking for a boxing game to practice boxing techniques, and/or are looking to exercise.",1614757326,3,0,494391

"walters log: 2020442044

it has been quite some time, sometimes i truly forget how much but here she finally is.
it's like a fever dream looking upon this, to truly be able to experience this still in my life time.

13 years we've waited for this, 13 years!

i must say it has been truly worth the wait, the memes and the sadness.
for a long while i saw no hope of seeing another entry, another chapter to something so beloved, so cherished by me and so many others.
where to begin?
yes it is vr only, half-life series have always been there to push, to raise the bar even higher.
valve has been working for years now on vr hardware, software and thinking with others on how to solve vr problems. it's all paid off now and it shows, you can be angry, frustrated but it won't change the future.

the game looks and runs fantastic for a vr game, starting off with a beautiful scenery showing the citadel under construction as the combine are working on transforming the newly acquired earth to suit their needs.
enemies are even more detailed, the clastrophic setting and the redesigned enemies make for a quite terrifying game at times.
headcrabs are extremely detailed as are barnacles.
for vr they've given a lot of things explicit sounds to make you more aware, help you settle in this new vr world.
puzzles are at times a little frustrating but nothing we can't handle, some puzzles also reveal more then you may have asked for, the combine stations open up to reveal what look like brains with occasionally a rat fused in there to make it all work.

valve went hard on this design that the combine is alien and cares very little for ethics or design as long as it works. valve does a ton of enviromental story telling with it's portrayel of it's world.

there is changes to suit vr better and the fact you play alyx, you're no longer a small powerhouse that can backhop across an entire drained oceans, you are much slower, you die a lot quicker and you get a total of 3 guns. you start out with a pistol, slowly work up to the shotgun and later on get what is like an earlier manual ar2. they never become obsolete at any point either and all serve a purpose.
while there's no melee you do get 2 types of grenades, a regular kind of grenade that you pop and throw and a xen grenade that can be taken infinetly which (with the index) you squeeze in real life to activate.

with various types of combine to fight including 2 types of grunts one with an explosive tank on the back (will video game enemies ever learn?) and another that can deploy up to 2 manhacks, a shock trooper with a shield that if he closes the distance can stun you and a gunner that does heavy damage but needs cool down to fire his minigun again.

zombies of course make a return together with headcrabs all in new even grosser detail.
while fast headcrabs and zombies aren't part of the cast the regular and poison are together with a new armoured headcrab.
barnacles also make their return and looking more detailed then ever they still eat everything organic and will attempt to eat anything you throw at them.

as the story progresses more things become clear and the end is especially worth it, i don't want to spoil any of this because those who know, know and those who don't are encouraged to find it out on their own.
valve truly delivers once more and i cannot wait to see if they live up to their ""making video games"" claims.

go play it.",1586027149,3,0,548970
"if you want to play a game with good physics and high peformance please for the love of god get this game. this game is the best vr game i have ever played ever. if you want to have completely physical weapons then get this game, if you want to do some sick take downs get this game. and this game can run on most pcs before when i had a 500 dollar pc when i played this game it ran smoothly. then i had a i5 or i2 with a gtx 350. this game also has some nice easter eggs and one of the best storylines i have every seen in video game history. its up there with resedent evil and half life. in fact this game was inspired by half life. also please wishlist stress levels zero upcoming game that is a continuation of this game but on the quest better particals and so much more, its called bonelab.

so if that is long get the game because the quality is great and the detail is on point with high peformance",1658797936,0,,119477708

"yes its good. vr is the next logiacl step if you've actually played it. stop being grumpy you do not know how to save up money. (if you are a student or don't have a job you are excused)

a lot of people here are complaining it is shorter than other half life games, and it really isn't. i completed my first playthrough in 13 hours.  a lot of people are saying it takes 10 hours to complete, if you have completed it that fast you have probably missed a lot of what makes this game great; pacing and exploration. 
seriously, take your time.

most memorable scene for me is chapter 7: jeff and of course the ending and after credits scene. 

thank you valve, half-life is back baby!


edit: please help me, i have a problem.

in general the game us solid, well built, good ui, stunning visuals, and great re-playability value. for those that grew up playing trans-am or off-road, this is a must.

 this is a nice prototype, but i finished everything i could do in about 30 minutes. killed the three bosses after forcing myself through the repetition. if there was more to it, like different ships, more commands for crew, customization, upgrades, ports and trading or something. maybe with more content that's deeper than aim and shoot, then i'd consider this again. as it stands i can't recommend anything but refunding.",1534894562,3,3,733835
"premise:
a level-based shooter (not a wave shooter) with duck and cover mechanics, upgradeable weapons, leveling (new levels unlock new, more powerful weapons), realistic reloading and a bunch of weapons to choose from.

pros:
great graphics
solid gameplay
challenging level designs and the ability to choose harder or easier real-time in the levels
best scope design i've seen in a vr game so far (not glitchy like most games)
upgrades have impact on your weapons.  you can definitely tell the difference between one type of barrel and the last, or even the next level of muzzle.

cons:
even though this is a room-scale game, your ability to walk around is limited to your cover available in the area you're in.  not taking cover means certain death.
becomes somewhat repetitive if you want to unlock the highest levels of armor and weapons with all upgrades.
static spawns and movement for enemies makes it a bit predictable for each level once you memorize them.  the enemies, however do tend to go to various locations and/or shoot from cover, etc.

it may not matter to some folks, but these guys were only in early access for 5 months and made updates like clockwork based on feedback.  that's how early access is supposed to work!

i look forward to the next series of levels for this game as well as weapon unlocks, etc.

"glad this finally came to the steam store (it was on the oculus rift store for a while). this is a purely cinematic view of nature. the stereoscopic 3d quality is top notch and you will nearly feel like you are really at these serene locations. the sound mix, however, could be improved. you get to visit 7 different locations (one is the main menu and another is a question mark). you can teleport to different viewpoints. you also get to a holographic recording of the narrator. 

i recommend turning the music off. it really doesn't fit the scenes. the videos are like on 5 second loops so you will see water running. however, some parts are just static (you will see a bird still in the air or people frozen in the far background). still, for being free, this is very high quality. shows off the magic of vr that can transport you to places that you'd probably never visit and make you think that you just might really be there. whole experience currently takes 15-30 minutes. 

[b]rate 8/10. thank you dev! hope you can bring more scenes. i would gladly pay for dlc of this high quality![/b]",1626481015,3,2,425015

one of my favourite vr games of all time. the mechanics in synth riders are way more fun than beat saber. having the hit box on your fists make you move more and have less strain on your wrists. only thing is that beat saber is way more established so it has more songs and custom maps available.,1675847565,0,,132412373

"pros:
- very accurate tracking and physics, which is impressive and makes the experience so enjoyable.
- so much customizations and options, you can really adjust it to your preferences. height and position of the table, color of the ball and table, how you hold the paddle etc.
- very stable and nice multiplayer. it's so much fun against other people. every match i played with others we were laughing, chatting and having crazy exchanges. 
- the community! relaxed, no flaming, often pretty skilled.
- it plays like real table tennis. you cannot achieve more with this kind of game.
- nice graphics and stages. stunning attention to detail: you can even shoot the ball out of the windows or use the walls.
- only 20 !

cons:
- singleplayer is fine with matches against the ai and highly customizable training options. but a little league, tournaments, progression, unlockable content etc. would be awesome. but i think it is too much to ask for considering it's not a 60  game.
- you need a lot of space. my playing area is 2,2 m x 1,5m and i hit my couch a couple of times :)
- vr is still not mainstream, so you sometimes play against people from the other side of the globe. such a fast game needs low pings.

"don't listen to the hate!

i find this game fantastic. the swordfighting is honestly better than vanishing realms' swordfighting, simply because it's faster-paced. and no offense to vanishing realms, as that game is also a beaut. 

this game is like the gateway to vr skyrim. please please download this awesome game. i know for a fact that other game devs are looking at this game in fear for the amount of things it does right.

also, download polygon runner (i think that's what it's called) first, if you have vertigo. sit down to polygon runner, and slowly build your vr legs. this game is slightly buggy, but it gets exponentially better with experience and with vr legs mode activated. 

dos: get this game and give it a fair chance.
don'ts: get this game, and leave a bad review because of vertigo.

the game itself is great. if you cannot recommend it due to vertigo, then by all means, but please make sure to open up this game again and edit your review after getting your vr legs. it truly is a gem in disguise..
and, well, i mean it's free and has easily triple the effort put into it than most other free vr games.

as for the game this is basically the first ever vr moba/hero shooter kind of like battleborn but in vr. it is very fun to play with and against other people, they have bots that fill in games if nobody is on.

(rift s video impressions and comparisons coming very soon!)

initial thoughts:
on the rift s this is by far the greatest star wars experience i have played in vr.
i'm pleased to say this does not feel like a quest port and more like the otherway round. the atmosphere, immersion, models and sets were all are stunning, and for a star wars fan like me, it felt like i was in a star wars movie. (a dream come true)
we've had a few free teasers over the years with 'trials on tatooine' and 'droid repair bay' but this feels like the main course. 
the game is around 40 mins long and leaves you wanting more. this is a great experience to show your friends and new people to vr just how powerful and immersive vr can be.
for those of you seeking more of a challenge after, the dojo recreates the classic star wars scene from 'a new hope' where luke skywalker is practicing his skills with the lightsaber combat droid.
i have never tried the star wars void experience but i have heard this is the closest thing and also a spin-of? how true this is i don't know.... but i do know the companion droid is the same one as used in the void.
parts 2 and 3 of this experience are still to come and i can't wait. i hope they add blasters!!!!",1561087414,5, ,343272

"didn't read any reviews. was an insta-purchase for me. i so enjoyed this on pcvr way back. mini-moto x and similar just didn't scratch the blaze rush itch for me. so glad to see this on a new platform.

"in all my years of gaming this is actually the first game i've refunded.

the vr is so tacked on, i expected that going in but i was also expecting at least some improvisation to accommodate  vr but there is barely anything. looting, inventory, menus, where almost impossible to use until i got mods to fix it.

i may buy this again but only if it's comes  under $20 because the current $60 price tag is way to high for such a low quality port.",1615654757,4,2,605858

"not much to the game except a repeat of combinations of punches and dodges. the levels are just longer periods of it with different songs. the pace doesnt feel like it always follows a rythmic beat so it feels more like you are shadow boxing with music on rather than boxing to the song. there also isnt height adjustment so the punches feel low. it would be better if there were more creative game modes, this feels too repetitive.",1563420214,5, ,174509

so i took the quest version which is crossbuy with the pc version on meta hoping to have the best of both worlds. but no update of the pc version for a very long time.
and here we have the steam version. no difference compared to the quest 3 version with qgo in hd+ mode.
if only we had the right to the meta pc crossbuy with the updated steam version. but i don't think that's on the agenda.

"at first i wasn't as into it as everyone seemed to be around me. but a few quests in, learning new cooking recipes, and exploring the large open world has really made me a fan! the community it shockingly nice. i don't think i've had a single negative experience with anyone. i've watched adults be nice to kids and help them. i've seen friendships made including some of my own. i've always been a mmorpg fan from the beginning. so getting into this wasn't to difficult for me. the quest directions definitely need some work. some people have had to guide me in the right direction and come to find out i had to go way inside a cave which seemed to be the opposite direction as the quest made out to be. i would love to see more weapon options, store items for sale including clothes, food, weapons, pets. i think this game is going to end up being one of the biggest quest games because of its scale. if you are looking for an adventure, exploration, and a game you can literally sink 100+ hours into from day 1.. then this game is for you! makes me so happy to see vr becoming more and more mainstream and diverse everyday.",1643777400,5, ,283483

as a game, though, it has a lot to be considered.

"now there's a reason why just about every reviewer you've read says that this game is the best game out there, and i'm glad they made this an all-vr game, too, since it's so superb that any hard-core ""flat-screen"" gamer will be an immediate vr convert after having played only five minutes of th, is. for once inside, you'll be wandering cold, wet, slimy caverns deep underground (some will be made of cinderblock and fluorescent lamp with soviet-era rubble strewn throughout, others will have so much alien biological overgrowth that you can scarcely move around it). you'll be fighting zombies or plucking off combine combatants from an elevated position on a bright, sunny afternoon, figuring out how to work a switchboard consisting of nothing but a 4 x 4 grid array of pushbutton switches while in a rotten swamp of corpses, filth, and walls with very strange, glowing alien hieroglyphics, and having meaningful conversation with russel, your guide for this game*.
     *note: i am currently at chapter 4 (of 10), meaning i haven't even played half this game yet.

     you will be hard-pressed to find a visual effect that does not look photo-realistic. the entire game is like this: the detail is quite astonishing, and many scenes are so true-to-form that you will wonder if you're watching actual video footage. the effects are that good.
physics effects are equally as detailed: empty cardboard boxes land with a soft thump and rock back and forth a couple times before coming to a complete rest; heavy objects can be thrown farther and are louder on impact. the rustling of your clothes can be heard when crouching down or investigating. echo and reverb give a good sense of room size and position.
hand weapons are very accurate: if you're missing shit then it's not the game, you really do suck at aiming. your laser-sight will produce a bright red spot that nervously flutters on the target, with a round fired from the weapon landing exactly where the red spot was. the laser spot becomes more composed and relaxed as you hold your arm out in a more controlled manner.

the file size is just enormous at 70gb! although this game is six times as large as my next largest game (lone echo; 13gb), this game plays like it. it plays like something large ad grand, like a superbly-written, 5-star movie that has a running time of days (broken up in volumes) rather than hours, only unlike the movie, you're playing the main actor!

will you like this game? yes. i don't need to know your likes or preferences, this game really is everything to everybody, so you will lie it without me needing to know anything more of you. it is a firearm/action game, but not excessively. it's a horror game, too, since therre are countless sequences that will have you shitting your pants and taking blood pressure pills. an adventure game? yes, you can say that half-life alyx is first and foremost an adventure game. and what an adventure it is, where, by the time you're done, will make you feel as if you've explored about half the city of soviet-era moscow...",1609066372,3,0,534370

"updated: after playing more rating went up
pros:
-*sometimes* environments look legitimately impressive and i forget this is mobile vr. i'm not very far and have said ""oh wow"" more than once.
-hands don't clip through world geometry - thank you!
-options for simple or manual reload - nice! this is the perfect compromise, when i'm dual wielding i can still reload, otherwise i can physically insert and remove magazines with my off hand. that's how it's done!
-weapon and character models look very nice!
-voice acting/music are top notch!
-some pretty cool action set pieces given the hardware
-i wasn't interested in warhammer before trying this, i sure am now!
-i initially wrote combat wasn't all that engaging. i was wrong, it starts to get real good in the second level when you're swapping between pistols and machine guns and the challenge has been ramping up. i've been forcing my self to manually reload and that does a lot to make combat more interesting, a kind of built in difficulty level and it feels so dang good.
-sound effects are great w/ headphones (quest 2 speakers don't do them justice)

cons:
-biggest problem is the range of quality in materials, which span from n64 rocks to current gen top tier mobile shaders in the same view. you can tell there's beautiful work under all that blur tho.
-the first level didn't leave the best impression 
-physics can feel a little jank at times, but i'd rather that than no physics, worth it and obvious hardware constraint.

if you're a huge warhammer fan or you are on the quest 1 it's a no brainer, the gameplay is totally there. no regrets purchasing, can't wait to see this w/ quest 2 updates and the pcvr version soon? i think? if a pcvr version is coming, wow can't wait! that would fix my only complaints probably!!! if this is cross buy, it's one heck of a bargain, if not it's a bit steep pre-multiplayer.",1607484214,5,"Hi Joel, thanks for updating your review.

"changed my review due to a recent update, but leaving the old review for the record.

dev's dropped a very dumb, very bad update. they recently reverted it, so the game is now ""honest"" again.
its a good workout, and a fun game. assuming the devs dont **** up again, then give it a go.

old review:
game was pretty great, and i used to think pretty highly of the devs, until a recent update. sets a pretty bad precedent when you crank up the difficulty on an existing mutator, but dont wipe the leaderboards. i say this has someone who has numerous #1 spots on the bullet hell boards: you guys goofed hard. the records that exist on those boards are now completely out of reach.

its like letting a few people set the longjump record on the moon before restricting it back to earth. you wrecked the competition, and you did it for no reason. nobody was crying for you to upgrade that difficulty, and if you really did want to, you could have just made a new mutator rather that just overwriting the old. hell, you could have just wiped the leaderboards and started fresh.

i'm well beyond the point of getting a refund, and i'm not going to stop play, but i also wont recommend the game to anyone in the future given the idea that they could just pull this crap again at anytime.

without the boards, this game is worth maybe 2 hours of fun, so get yours in if you want, and then refund it.",1645750631,2,0,376888
"the game seems fun and all, but as soon as i took a two handed sword and tried to do a horizontal swing, ending up with nothing like that (controller movement or even position for that matter does not translate well into the game)

"not as indepth as saints and sinners, but honestly i didn't go into this game expecting that. it's a cheaper game, it originally was a co-op game until they changed it to be basically 2 game modes. a quick ""scavenge"" mode where you basically go through either a small stretch of a town area where you go into buildings at the side to get items and supplies for quests and loots that you can put into alexandria to upgrade yourself.

there's a weapon upgrade station in alexandria, the aforementioned place where you upgrade your town (which you don't get to walk about which is a little sad), a weapon upgrade station where you can add little abilities to weapons and more practical stuff like laser sights, daryl being a moody brooding dude as always where you can do his campaign, a board where you get small quests to do on the scavenger missions, discount michonne standing next to the map where you choose where you wanna scavenge and a van where you go to your scavenger missions.

again, it's not as indepth as saints and sinners, but this game leaves the whole ""looting"" part of gameplay to the side more to basically let you feel way more powerful than you ever did in s&s. if you want instant gratification and just a simple good time killing walkers? yeah, this is a decently fun game.

the voice acting isn't horrible, but it is a little lack lustre in places. but one thing that i can say more than anything else?

it's fun.

[edit]

so, i completed the game... honestly, even with the overhaul to all weapons in the game, i'd have to give this one a pass unless you really don't have anything better to do.",1601459041,2,0,379451

"this game has gotten a lot of bad press and i'm not sure why. if i had to guess, i would say it's due to some unrealistic expectations. i think people were expecting a aaa title to revolutionize the vr expereince. while that is not the case, the title is solid. think of it as a refined version of what vr has offered thus far. while it is not doom in it's entirety, it is a doom experience and a great one at that. to give you an idea of where i'm coming from, onward and pavlov are my vr staples. i play seirento quite often and enjoyed arizona sunshine. these games are what i would consider solid vr titles. i would rank this game among them, though it is it's own entity.
the visuals are very refined and it's pretty spectacular to see some of the creatures towering over you. the action is fast paced and i feel the controls (which seem to be a main area of complaint) work well and keep the player engaged without inducing simulator sickness. i felt the teleport and short dash worked well with the dual wield. with action this fast i feel like locomotion could have been a little problematic.
i would absoultely recomend this game!

the cons:
my main complaint about this game is it's length. i can tell i'm nearing the end and i already want more. the game is quite awsome. i have a very hard time turning it off. it also offers some great challenge. i plan to play through on every difficulty level. a horde mode and some dlc are something to look forward to (though with the price to length ratio of this game it had better be at a reasonable price).
there does need to be the ability to adjust the graphics setting. it has crashed about 4 times so far. i feel like being able to adjust the resolution in smaller increments and/or being able to turn off mirroring on the monitor (so that the computer isn't doing double duty) would be helpful. once i changed the display setting to windowed i didn't have any further crashes. not sure if it's a glitch or a coincidence.

"first off, this is actually a fairly good and a well made title. touch controller are supported but not listed as a supported controller option here. my only real complaint is why that music has to be so loud? anyway, i do feel this game could do with some additions and changes. first up, i really want to turn off the radio as the information being said isn't what is currently happening. like the ""thousands of lights"" that circle the craft. i realise doing that in game would create a serious lag for people with lower end pc's, but i personally would have loved to have seen that. 

while we're on the topic of sound, please give us the option to turn off that music. talk about loud! did i already mention that? for the ultra graphic's setting, i would have liked a more hd starscape and earth textures. don't get me wrong, i was completely blown away with the view, but the stars seemed a bit blurry and earth looked like i was looking at a google earth image close up. not sure if that was just me, but there you have it. now it terms of additions, i want to see a free roam mission envolving a space station and some satilites (docking, undocking, repair and deployment all freely done in an open world environment), and a free roam mission for taking off and landing again at will. i also want to have some thrust controls beyond simple turning. 

also, maybe a top secret mission involving a ufo and/or some weapons testing. with the amazing detail you have put in here, that would be amazing to see and i believe you would do it so incredibly well. i realise its not historical, but a bit of sci-fi  wouldn't hurt and would only add to the replay value in the long run.",1529637814,5, ,334875

"this is easily one of the funnest vr games, and games in general i have ever played. i haven't played a crazy amount, but this game i think has perfected vr melee combat. it's responsive, and incredibly satisfying. my dopamine receptors were going crazy every time i did a perfect parry counter, or a perfect last minute dodge teleport to save my life. 

this is coming from a guy who religiously plays b&s, and is obsessed with melee combat, trust me if you want a game that makes melee combat truly satisfying this is the one. i hope you're not turned away by graphics as this game proves games aren't about that.

also i love how rewarding the game is, it really feels like if you're a skilled player you can cut down enemies without a single death which adds so much fun to the game. 

there's also a good amount of weapon variety for whatever play style you want but i personally always go with dual swords as it is the funnest for me personally.

i struggle to find any cons, but in order to be fair i will try.

con wise, at first i felt the movement was kinda sluggish. i've never played a vr game where the main character moves this slow. but what i thought was some sort of bug is clearly just part of the games design. the character you play as has the ability to teleport, and atleatst for me that's the main way you should be moving around.
plus if your character moved really fast the game would be too easy as you could just walk away from every attack. 
having teleportation as the main form of movement makes it so you actually have to think about what you're doing.

the only other con i can think of is maybe the game is too short? i haven't beaten it yet but it seems like i've gotten a fair bit into it already, maybe i'm just that good tho.



that's it, then. the game is a solid 10 for me as the fun i've had playing this makes it one of the best vr experiences out there. well worth the money.",1736040272,0,,184793001

"please note that i have yet to complete the game and a lot of my hours are exploration/experimentation, but i have a few things to say about boneworks. for one, it's revolutionary- the vr industry will certainly take note of the competence and completeness of this title. however, it certainly has its problems. one of the biggest is that it doesn't have proper saving, only continuing at the start of a level, which can lose you a ton of progress. continuing this way also removes your weapons as far as i know, which you can buy with currency. these poor checkpoints also apply to dying- often times you can just step in something you're not supposed to and end up restarting the whole level. this makes the game very frustrating, but the mechanics are good enough that the first time going through levels is an incredible experience. i would recommend this game, as it is above the overwhelming majority of vr games right now, but i do think it fails as a whole.",1576125962,0,0,723922

"played with oculus + touch. (recommendation accordingly)

i really like the concept, art and sounds (it was pretty immersive), but the puzzles were actually quite easy to solve, so i would like to see a more difficult one.
the touch controller had a lot of bugs (didn't grip objects very well and on a certain keypad it was very difficult to hit the keys correctly without entering the same number a couple times). something i would suggest to the devs is to highlight the object you are about to grip/touch.
the physics were nice, but also had some bugs were objects went flying through the room (when the object is an important one, this can be quite annoying). luckily i found the object somewhere else in the room, so it didn't break the game :).

i solved the room in 25 minutes, but this includes a bathroom break of about 10 minutes (you cannot pause the game, so if you want to set a fast time, make sure you won't be interrupted by something) and lots of trying to pick up an object.

overall, i think it has potential, but it needs changes in the puzzle design and at least for touch users, it needs fixing mechanic wise. spending 8 euro's for about 15 minutes of gameplay is not worth it right now in my opinion, but if more escape rooms will be added later (which i hope will be added to this game and not created as new games in a series), it might become a very interesting game.

at the time being, i wouldn't recommend this yet (again, at least for touch users and at this price), but keep an eye on it!",1491470698,3,0,610308

i¡¯m sure enough people have described the good things so i¡¯m going to talk about the stuff that¡¯s not working for me - which is very little tbh 

1. scope - i find it difficult to accurately use without a physical gun stock. it goes almost fully black - likely due to my positioning or it seems like i collide through the gun - again i think a physical gun stock would help with these issues. 
2. grabbing stuff - i have to be really accurate in my position to be able to get the hand symbol to show up. this takes up quite a bit of time. 
3. the star system for progression. given how janky the mechanics are i feel like this makes the game too hard to progress in. it should be optional.

my one recommendation for the game as far as additions go (aside from the things you guys are already doing like new games, maps, etc.) would be to experiment with some non gun items you can pick up, maybe like mini health pack that recharges in your hand (also louder footsteps). idk but this game is great and definitely worth a buy.",1660485660,5, ,257509

the game is getting frequent updates and patches making the game better each day. the developers care about the game and it seems like from here the game can only get better. aswell as this i know the game has a lot of concepts and ideas for the future that will make the game even better, i¡¯ve even seen some concept designs and they look good and look like they will add a lot to the game. 

one of the best aspects of the game is the community. the discord is active and helpful. community events are setup frequently, the people actually help new players to learn the basics. tournaments are setup either by devin or with the help of devin and the best part is the community is just getting bigger allowing bigger tournaments and more competition. the 'gurrah houses' (check their discord for information about the houses) are a nice touch to the game and make finding new players to play with easier.

will make you think of ender¡¯s game. but it¡¯s not. there is a little violence (you can punch other robots to make them drop the frisbee) but it¡¯s not the point or the focus. the focus is the adjustment challenge of maneuvering in zero-g by pulling yourself along the scenery and using thrusters. it tackles this challenge very well.

only trouble is, it¡¯s not that fun. the sport i mean. it gets old as soon as the novelty wears off. 
unfortunately, the game makes you sit through an over half-hour unskippable tutorial, even motion locking you while it¡¯s lecturing you so you can¡¯t even play in the zero-g while waiting for the robot-tutor to shut up. so by the time that¡¯s over, the novelty isn¡¯t long for this world.

"[*][h1]about[/h1]
[/list]
as per the plot, you are trying to find your sister, that is somewhere... dead or alive, in this hotel with a fairly misleading name. trust me... there is nothing paradisiacal about this particular hotel... quite the oposite.
this is plain and simple... a horror story! bring a change of underware.

[list]
[*][h1]gameplay[/h1]
[/list]
this is a classic survival horror story but with so much more. you get to use a couple of guns that feel realistic, will find a variety of interactable items (e.g. flashlight, healing... but much more), it has great puzzles that are well inserted into the context of the story (in opposite of being random and overly difficult but having no relation), there are a few collectables if you are into that... a few types of zombies that contribute for that change of underware... and the cherry on top of the cake... the visuals/sound/atmosphere that really keep you on your toes with whatever is lurking in the dark.

[list]
[*][h1]visuals & sound[/h1]
[/list]
the combination of visuals, sound and overall atmosphere is by far the main selling point where it really enhances the experience and you are always on the look out. in regards to the jumpscares... if you are anything like me... you will put that change of underware to good use.

[list]
[*][h1]length | replayability[/h1]
[/list]
it is a fairly short story that will take you anywhere from 3 to 4 hours, depending on how long you get stuck on some puzzles, however the game is fairly intense and feel it delivers its purpose as an horror story. 

[list]
[*][h1]worth buying?[/h1]

purely judging by the playtime versus baseline cost i believe some people would likely dislike the price, however, post playing and considering the genre of the game and how well made it is where you can see the time and investment that went in to create a great experience, i didn't feel i over payed.
if anything, in case the developers are looking to create follow up stories in order to avoid these feeling like overextend just for play time, they can consider reducing the baseline price of each one.

"[h1] good game, but... [/h1]
after playing 5 matches and trying to use every gun and consumables in the game within 2 hours, here's my view on this game.
not bad gameplay wise, the game is [b]very[/b] arcade-like with a cross-hair where the gun is pointing at and the reloading where you already have the next mag, you just need to finish putting it in all the way and chamber the bullet(s). t-pose to glide while shooting kids in the face with a olympia at point blank. eating bananas and drinking soda like an obese child at mcdonald's. this game also has building like forknight (that barely anybody uses). lastly, climbing like you're a monkey. so if you are looking for just fun (with yourself or friends) i think this game is ok.[b] only problem [/b]is the sniper scope takes your eyes and makes you[i] ""become one with the scope"". [/i]they should really figure out how to make a sniper scope that doesn't take your eyes. (like pavlov or something [i]*cough cough*[/i])
graphically though, it's ok as it look like a early 2000 game but in vr. though the game should have more higher graphical options for pc vr people as this game dramatically changed the graphics from the trailer to make the game compatible to every vr system.
other things though in the game as i was super skeptical about this game, i could not find any videos or any discussions about this game other than what i described already above is this game has[b] micro-transactions in an already 20-30 dollar game[/b]! not only that, they removed on getting free unlimited gold by doing tasks/quests right before they launched the first season. though you can still get gold, it just won't be unlimited. what i saw of the tasks/quests in the game for the free gold and the little increase with each new free gold tasks/quests, i believe it's roughly 300-ish that equates to 5-ish dollars according to the in-game store. (that's if you get all the tasks/quests done.)
this is a[b] huge [/b]letdown for me with this game. maybe if the game was half price or even free, it would be somewhat reasonable.
if the arcade style with some slight gameplay problems and micro-transactions doesn't bother you then it's a ok game.",1614810464,2,0,687261
"just awesome!!! if you are a fan of music then you will love this app.
the ability to almost make a song completely your own is the best. even songs that you are not a fan of can be taken, stripped, remixed, and twisted to your liking.

the lauch list of 40 songs may seem somewhat short but i have spent almost 2 hours on 4 songs when i initially played it. and that even includes a song i didnt like that i made into something that i do like.
this will be a blast at parties for sure. even for the not so musically inclined the app drops whatever instrument they have payed on the beat so there is no thought necessary.",1533665700,3,0,686796

- only pvp now, i get that making a single player campaign is more expensive for the devs, but some procedural generated missions, with a open world like mechwarrior mercs, will give this game a huge replay-ability, otherwise, it will be just another mech shooter arena (hawken much?)

"updates11/5/18
just figured id update the review because its been a while. this is one of the most underated games in vr. buy it. 

update: 10/18/2017

this game continues to amaze me, and the developer continues to set the bar. this game gets more updates than most other vr titles period. this developer is constantly adding new things to the game and they really know what they are doing. most recently they added a battle royale mode which is basically pubg for vr and it is amazing. i cant emphasize enough how much better this dev is than most other devs. i have had the vive since release and i own over 70 games. i have watched dev after dev abandon their games because all they wanted was a quick cash grad. hoverjunkers is a prime example of an abandoned game. i use to love onward with a passion. i was in the league and my team did very well. now i rarely play that game because the dev is a recluse who never updates his game. this game on the other hand, constantly has new experiences for me. i know it sounds like i'm stroking this dev right now but i just want to see more people buy this game instead of one of the neglected turd games out there because this game really deserves your money. also, i am absolutely not being compensated for this review and i paid full price for the game. 

if you don't have this game already you are missing out. i didn't even realized this game existed until recently but now it is all i play. the parachuting and helicopters are such an amazing experience considering they are still experimental. the bots in this game are also better than the bots in onward imo. the thing i appreciate the most about the game is how often the developer posts updates. its frustrating how many vr games have slow or no development after launch but this dev is constantly putting out patches. i cant wait to see what the future holds for this game and if you are on the fence about it, i have over 200 hours in onward and ive barely touched it since i found this game. buy it. to the dev: i'm not sure what you have to do to get more people to see this game but i legit didnt even know it existed until a few weeks ago. i love it. keep up the great work.",1500676267,3,0,516088

"achievements seem a bit funky at times, and the guns get a little bit wonky, but honestly, it's a solid as hell game, being moba vr, which i never even conceived of as a possibility.

there should be more to my review than this, but i want to get a positive one out before the night ends, so this may be a work in progress. my first-time experience went excellently. i was fortunate enough to meet a person who walked me through the controls, which lacked a bit of explanation.

-basic gameplay-
as a valve index user, i initially experienced hiccups with the controls, but quickly fell into a groove. the vital gameplay mechanic in-game is the usage of one's abilities. they are communicated using a sometimes too small window above the hand used for shooting, and the timer could use a text overlay for more precise players. in basics, it is a system that should either afford more options to the player (which i shall thoroughly look through tomorrow, and edit this section based upon,) and could do with a bit of streamlining. these issues, however, only made me focus on how strong the core gameplay was. it surprised me quite a bit, using smart visual cues to communicate wordlessly what abilities do, with an eye to what is visible within a vr headset. cypher, an automaton, occupies a familiar role as a champion with a grenade launcher and contrasts in bright colours with the numerous other members of the roster. towers are the only aspect herein that require work, as i have not been able to easily understand their range.

-a step deeper into the fray-
mechanically, each champion has a varied playstyle and interesting abilities that correspond. one melee champion wields a dagger, with the ability to silently teleport behind enemy lines, poisoning and disorienting a player not quite quick enough on their feet, or a long-ranged arbalist, who can lay claim to an area with fire and healing. there is a degree of communication between the teams, which truly does feel nice within vr. this is, of course, helpful, because in some aspect the vr can be found... imperfectly immersive.

-vr aspects-
this game uses a fixed body system. being a lover of blade and sorcery, i have learned to appreciate and even prefer having a visible body, but in this game, it is completely stationary. this can lead to a bit of discomfort as you try to figure out where exactly your head should fit, especially when you're used to room-scale like i am. i would prefer a hud for my abilities affixed to my head as mentioned earlier, rather than them being locked to my arm, as sometimes during a firefight, it can be tough to take the time to look down and away from the enemy, toward your hand. a glance-friendly system would be much appreciated.

-content-
worrisome, and rightfully so, is content. i don't know how to say this in a way where the developers of this game will hear me, but i can feel the depth of the ""lake"" just by dipping a toe. this entire review has been an affair of remarks about the game in its functionality, but the interplay of champions and their abilities can only go so far. what remains to be seen is how the gameplay can fit into something bigger. the introduction of a laning system, a control point map, game-changing jungle buffs, anything that can give these titans a sense of identity in relation to not just each other, but the game itself! it could allow this game to clinch a market that i do think should exist. people play moba's. in the modern world, they're kind of a big deal, and seeing as this game has a basis this strong, layering on some of that polish could actually make this an insane little gem. it's no small task, but it's one that would be quite the big deal for both a vr lover and a moba addict. essentially, this nerd right here. :)

so here's to a future for both this review and this game. i'll be back with a better version. i hope the negativity here doesn't detract from the thumbs up i'll be giving. just as an experience, it's pretty unique, and deserves a chance. i'm just hoping they really do something with the little slice of genius they already have here.",1589022108,0,2,739733

"update: just thought i'd update to say that i've now been using tripp for well over a year and still find it fricking awesome. the devs keep adding new meditations and new settings, so it hasn't lost it's freshness. i find the ""focus"" tripps a little repetitive, but the ""calm"" ones have basically been my survival kit for life in 2021. if you have an anxiety issue and you enjoy using vr, i can't see how you could go wrong by purchasing tripp: i really can't. 

original review: so tripp is basically meditation made perfect. it's fricking awesome. i've tried to meditate for decades without success: could never still my mind enough. well, tripp's clever use of stunning visuals just wipes that problem right away! within seconds i'm there, right in the zone, my breathing has slowed and i'm meditating. the voice over guides are always very good, and provide enough diversity to keep you reaching for the next day's content. the latest update - in which i can build my own meditation - is fantastic. 

i've had my quest 2 for six months, and there's two apps i use *every* day. tripp is one of them. honestly, there's no way you'll regret this purchase: it's just brilliant.",1671762720,5,"Hi!

"i don't write a lot of reviews (for reasons which i won't get into) but this game compels me to do so, as this is the kind of content i would like to see more of for vr.

5.8 hours in and it's better even than i expected. the graphics are clean and bright, the tutorials and mission progression is intuitive, and the controls (oculus touch) feel pretty good for the current technology.

the game takes me back to the first time i played starfox on the nes. great feeling of flight.

i prefer to have more tactile feedback in all the games i play (especially in vr) but the touch controller implementation is good.

i often find myself letting my hand drift away from the flight stick (and i won't lie, that's frustrating) but i am becomming more aware of hand positioning.

joystick support (not just gamepad, bleh) such as throttle, pedals and joystick would earn this game a 5/5 stars for me.

overall, the game so far (i am a completionist so i only just bought the rocket-glider) is crisp, well polished, fun for all skill levels and very much worth the asking price.

i give it a 4.5 out of 5 until/unless they add real controller support.

also, for the folks who have trouble getting the view height to a comfortable position, i would suggest recalibrating your hmd. it is spot-on for me and minor head movement while re-centering the view put the stick exactly where i want it.

"a lot of fun, with excellent storytelling! the brooding scenery looks fantastic with a decent score to make it all that much more authentic. 

the sabre fighting quickly devolves into the usual chaos of mediocre fight games, with the training¡¯s parry and cut instructions being too basic and a bore in the robot training, or with a single opponent, yet impossible to keep up with when there¡¯s multiple opponents. that needs nuance with more time and gameplay mechanics in both the coding and scenario devoted to those duels. it¡¯s an ¡®everything coming at-ya at once¡¯ solution that has you swinging wildly, knocking over furniture and falling on your butt. of course practice might change that, but i¡¯m not hooked enough to repeat the whole narrative in order to try and retry to find more depth to the fights.

i don¡¯t see it having very much replay value, once the 20 minute-or-so game is completed, but if you¡¯re a star wars fan (who isn¡¯t), then it¡¯s narrative and cinematic scope is probably worth the investment. think of it as paying around ¡ê33 to see 3 parts of a vr interactive star wars spin off and that seems good value, then you won¡¯t be disappointed.",1589772214,5, ,124178

if you have a vr headset and don't have this game, buy it when you have the chance. once the main game is finished, there is full workshop support for you to play with. half-life is famous for the community content that comes from it so i can bet that the workshop will continue to grow for a long time.

it's a really unique gameplay concept. the part i love the most is that the the advantages and disadvantages of motion control room scale are very important factors in how you play this game. 

the advantages being that you can hold and manipulate objects outside of your field of view, arrange them how you like so you can keep track of the gameplay using your own style.

the disadvantages are, as in real life, you only have limited space to arrange your world, visual and auditory distractions in game can actually make you look away at the wrong moment and miss the action. 

that might not make sense to someone who hasn't tried it. so go ahead, try it, its free!

the pc version is pretty much the same except for some visual flourishes, however after doing quite a bit of gpu profiling, i've come to find that this game is way more taxing on my hardware than it should be. it is more demanding on my rtx 2080 super than hl: alyx, onward (both 1.7 and 1.8), boneworks and a number of other demanding games. 

the pc version needs some optimization.",1627788214,5, ,350974
"if you love playing cod or any fps game, then i guarantee you 100% buy this. but here¡¯s some ups and down,

i really think the maps are brilliant but there aren¡¯t too many game mods with this. the game gets pretty hard and confusing once you start playing this, on some different guns you would reload in a different way which really bothers me. you can kill each other in this game as well and it gets annoying when trollers just literally stab you behind your back with a knife. i really think they should get new voices for the deaths of the ai¡¯s and such. but overall i could say this has to be one of the funnest games i¡¯ve played on vr.",1598844214,5, ,229217

..ok fine ill write an actual review.
[strike]the version of the game at the time of writing is currently early access u12 with 1.0 on the very distant horizon.[/strike]

game's leaving early access literally weeks after i made this. oops. anyway yea heres to hoping it'll be good

blade and sorcery advertises itself as a vr melee & magic fighting game but honestly a more accurate description would be ""vr fantasy physics sandbox"".
sure you can swordfight and spell cast, pick up a spear or a hammer, whatever, but you can also just as easily use telekinetic power to pick up a nearby barrel and bash your adversary in the back of their big, stupid unsuspecting head.

want to ditch the weapons altogether and get your hands bloody? you can absolutely do that. your fists are just as powerful as anything else with enough force, and the enemies are grabbable from multiple different points on their body. (can't headbutt tho)

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255851703

enemies themselves are a little underwhelming, big meat sacks with canned animations and cold, expressionless stares, limited to one-handed weapons and dual wielding. if you punish them hard enough they either fall over (great opportunity for a finisher) or die. a few different classes with some unique abilities. they can do just about everything you can besides kick, grab, or jump. i don't know if they're fun to fight, per se, but they are fun to torture, so they serve their purpose well enough.

let's say you want to ditch the fighting as well.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255824863 

that's ok. like i said this is a physics sandbox game. everything behaves at least mostly how you'd expect it to, so theres plenty of fun to be had in experimenting.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255837805


the maps are decently sized, have plenty of props, and unique areas, and are very traversable. see somewhere, you can probably go it. although, if you can't see it, you likely can't go there. there are invisible walls. i can tell you right now that almost all doors you see are unopenable. but i can't say the same for kill barriers. from my experience the maps have no kill barriers, only damage will do you in.
misjudge the distance of a jump and fall into the canyon map's... well... canyon?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255810056

it's not the end for you. aim your fall into the river that runs through it, then find dry land, and use the bricks of the bridge to climb your ass back up there, because the game has a climbing detection system.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255812691 

granted, it's a little finicky, but if you really get tired of the trial and error of finding edges to grab on, you can turn on an option that lets you climb anything. see if you can descend a mountain without killing yourself, it's an interesting challenge.

the version of the game you see youtubers playing probably isnt the exact same game because the modding community is (somewhat) healthy. nexus mods (and the other one i won't name, i guess) hosts plenty. creators i would recommend checking out are hujohner for various quality of life and just overall cool mods, mxthic and fable005 for a wider variety of maps, and i would also recommend looking on youtube for various mod reviewers who will probably give you a list of the ""essential"" ones they use to max their fun.

every update seems to break mods from the previous update, so you may be disappointed to find that some don't work. if you really want to use those, you'll have to either wait for a port, or visit the betas tab, sorry to say.
also keep in mind that the more mods you add, the more are likely to conflict, and the more unstable your game will get. some of these bugs can get really egregious, but if you're willing to turn a blind eye and use your imagination, the game is still playable at the end of the day.

some are truly incompatible tho, so be wary of that.

i could go on, but this has gotten long enough and you've got other reviews to read.
tl;dr, i'd recommend it, but the base game is a bit lacking. thankfully you've got gameplay settings and mod support for that.",1716842351,0,,166182368

overall the flight models and physics are excellent.  i've flown light aircraft and microlights, and can definitely say that the flight models handle well.  

the missions are addictive as you seek to improve your times (such as flying through the rings).  a small tip would be to use small amounts of rudder when banking (in the direction of the turn) this helps speed the turn, and also balance it which may reduce nausea.  

graphically, you'll forgive the cartoon style scenery graphics (you get a great sense of flight and height/movement) as the overall experience is really positive with fun, realistic flight models.  

one comment would be in free flight mode, can we have all three aircraft available without having to purchase them (just for use in free flight?)  this is one sim i can't put down, currently with the rocket powered glider.",1503631414,5,Thanks for the review.

Each route in The Manor takes around 10 -20 minutes to complete (although there have been some people that take much longer and others that never made it all the way to the end!) There are 2 routes in The Manor with alternate endings to each route, so it would need to be played several times in order to experience all the scares!

In addition to The Manor we also have 2 other experiences: The Gauntlet and The Darkness. The Gauntlet is a spooky sppedrun against the clock, where randomized events will do their best to freak you out and slow you down. We have a local leaderboard as well as a global leaderboard, so you can compete against yourself or other Oculus users to get the best time.

The Darkness is our scariest walkthrough yet, with only a candle to guide you through parts of The Manor never seen before. In this unique walkthrough it's the things you can't see that make it hard to get to through!

I know the whole development team have put a lot of effort into making sure AFFECTED: The Manor offers great value to our community by choosing a low price point, whilst adding free DLC along the way, so it sounds like perhaps you didn't get to try all the content if you were able to make it through in just 5 minutes.

"now then what do i have to say about this trainwreck. hmm well i guess ill start off with how i heard about this i was one of the many many people who played the original demo which was amazing the guns and the melee weapons worked fine, zombies reacted properly, and the controls didn't make me want to fucking stab someone. this is not that i was extremely confused at first when i booted this up i was expecting to spawn in my apartment and my ""character"" says some jargen talks to wife/girlfriend blaa blaa zombies are here now but no. we do some talking out loud fumbling bascially cause they removed alot of things the demo had and it needed those for sure. for when the game kept telling me i needed to get say my gun i needed to search a bag simple nuff right? right? no not really since they removed the little bubble when you can search something and how long it takes. so i had to fumble around checking every little thing listening for the little searchy searchy. so far i was not really happy then its time to kill your first all right lets go *swings cleaver* and it fucking bounces like a balloon fucks sake why. now skip ahead a wee bit and im almost out im told to shoot some zombies and clear the way alright simple enough but not really im looking through the scope looking for them but theres nothing but one little shit slouched down blending in so i just tap him with the might zeus. then a magic ladder lowers and im at street level so far im really not that happy since i've been waiting for damn long for this. and it is just complete and utter shit disapointed considering how the demo did so much better. anyways then im walking down the street and my ""character"" yells out suddenly *theres too many im sorry ill find a different way* then it just cuts to black and i was completly fucking confused. i learned somehow i got an *ending* at this point i just gave up on it bascially and came here to tell you this tale.
in conclusion the devs really fucked up and need to fix this because me and many others have been waiting for something worth something but this? barely worth 10 dollars. please devs fix this game and i'll be changing my review until then ill just hope for it to become better.",1530480292,2,0,683583

my only negative comment at this point is it doesn¡¯t seem to be a big enough player base to play for lobbies more than two or three matches but that also seems to be improving with the work that the developers are doing, and well maybe more weapons.

if you¡¯re a beginner player and want any more quicker?ttk start with the ump , not the duel uzi¡¯s.

"this game has some good and bad, but overall it's pretty cool. 

pros:
- movement system
- fairly big open world

cons:
- graphics are pretty bad
- not a lot of content

i haven't put a ton of time into this one, but it did keep me around for a couple hours. i have a fairly large backlog of boring vr games that have around .5 hrs on them so i would say this is at least interesting enough to play around in for a while.",1537821124,0,0,590624
"everything in game is done with a real life action.  there is no hud, and no point system in game.  there is a tablet you get out of your butt that you use for a map, and you can actually throw grenades/smokes by throwing your controllers across the room.  this game is an awesome simulator and possibly the best vive game out right now (big claim, i know)",1472802068,0,1,502112
"if you like metro, than you'll like this game as a fan.. yet it's not like hl-alyx since its restriction on what you can interact with. 
it does give you the metro vibes and atmosphere, but it doesnt feel like you can get immersed in ""putting your hands on everything you see"". 

scores:
story - n/a ( didnt finish the game)
metro world - 9/10 (could change)
""touchy grabby"" - 2/10 (the most common touchable objects are bottles and canned soup)
horror aspect (personal) - 2/10 ( im just a degen.. and i cant get scared much)

overall 6/10 ( not including personal horror aspect)

should you buy it ? 
- yes. at least try it out for less than 2 hours and refund it.  ( set up a timer before you launch the game )

"this must be the most impressively agile first-person vr game we have ever had the joy of playing. the devs quite clearly set out with trying to make you feel like a genuinely skilled ninja of sorts, and they don¡¯t fall too short of perfection there. giving you the freedom to jump incredible heights, crouch slide, wall run, double jump and even slow downtime. combined with combo choices of various guns and full-length katanas that can slice your enemies clean in half, you feel like the final boss 30 seconds into the first mission!

there¡¯s seemingly lots of content in sairento, but of what we tried we absolutely adored, the main bulk of the content seems to be centred around an outnumbered but rarely outgunned horde fight between yourself and increasingly difficult enemies, that you will learn to eliminate in constantly evolving strategies and manoeuvres. we imagine the majority of your time will be spent high up in the air jumping from platform to platform aiming a headshot at one enemy while you simultaneously raising your sword to slice the limbs off another¡­ like we said, crazy stuff. for a game as fast-paced and all over the place as sairento is, we expected quite a lot of motion sickness to come with it, and while it does have slight moments of stomach jigs, for the most part, we were comfortable with the movement, however, new vr users may wish to ease themselves in with less intense games first.

sairento¡¯s downsides are only that swordplay can sometimes be a little janky and the controls don¡¯t yet seem perfect ¨C for instance, teleporting uses forward direction of the analogue stick and snap-looking left or right uses left/right movement of the stick, meaning not only is it hard to go backwards if you mess up a jump, but sometimes you¡¯d teleport without even meaning to. we¡¯re sure a combination of post-release polish and regular player practise will evaporate these frustrations.

"before i start, i did work up a sweat playing. should be 5/5 stars however....the devs need to sort out a way to allow us to change the lag with our punches. i see many people complain about they miss some shots, but after playing, it is apparent that the timings that i play are slightly out of sync with the beat. i punch in what i think ¡®is¡¯ in time but i¡¯m told i miss. it works if you hold your hand out early, but defeats the point of the music...if there was a way to allow a slider setting for punch delay (or the opposite) to ¡®hit¡¯ the targets it would seem to solve the problem (if you¡¯ve played the latest guitar hero it allows you to change your press timing with the beat to sync up your personal delay and this would make this game great!). nevertheless, back to the game, simple but enjoyable to the extent you forget you¡¯re actually doing exercise (albeit the lag in your punches to the music as described above which is frustrating when you move out of time to the actual blocks). there¡¯s great future with updates to this game and you¡¯ll need a replacement foam padding once you¡¯re done as it does get the heart pumping (#sweaty! ??)...maybe one day they¡¯ll bring out hamburgers to smash, pizzas to block, or some other fun modifier such as holes in the floor to (pretend to) swap feet which would help burn the pounds, but until then, just 4 stars due to the ¡®punch early (before the beat)¡¯ system. it is good fun though and will burn the spare tire...definitely get it for exercise, there¡¯s no better fat burning comparison out there on the quest (take as you will)...

i've had my rift s for over a year now and i've played  some fun games and a lot of disappointing ones as well.  this game is by far the greatest vr game i have ever played.  i got absolutely hooked on this game and started putting in 5 hour sessions straight sometimes because i just couldn't put it down.  i just 100% completed it today and i'm actually kind of sad about it because i really want there to be more (this game is very long especially for a vr game so that wasn't at all a hit on the hours you can spend in this game).  this captures all the elements you want and it's clearly built from the ground up for vr which makes a world of difference.  if you own a vr capable computer and a headset you should not waste your money on anything until you buy this game.,1602818614,5, ,318551

despite what looks initially to be an interesting crafting and potentially semi-free roam world, the game ends up being a fairly linear and repetitive journey through increasingly spongier enemies. most difficult enemies can be kited or safespotted around basic obstacles, but the final boss does prove to be a nice change of pace with a proper challenge. some bugs and gaps in flow (like enemies destroying your base constructs before you get the chance to even fight them, or getting stuck on impasread moresable terrain) really set the game back.

to start this off, if you are a parent looking for games for your child to play. vrchat is not it. most kids that get their hands on this game tell you every slur, or insult they can think of. there are quite a bit of older people looking specifically for children, if you can see where im going with that. and there is such thing as sexual assault, in vr. and in vrchat there are avatars within anyone's reach including nsfw toggles, and nsfw faces.

"it is my opinion that, if you have a rift s, you have no need for this program. in addition, while i have never used a vive pro, i would think that would be the only good headset for this software (this is a general statement applying to virtual desktops). it only took me a couple of minutes to realize that the text was too blurry with my rift s to warrant using this program for any kind of work and i already have the big screen app from oculus for when i want to watch videos.

edit (8/21/2019):
considering that the developer of this app has started acting defensively, i feel further explanation is needed.

i said one has no need for this software if one has a rift s because two separate programs can accomplish the same thing for free. yes, from what i could see, this software does have some better features to it that are not readily available to rift s desktop, but the point i made wasn't that the features weren't available, it was that there was a free program offered through oculus to provide the same features.

i also wrote that the image issue was caused by my rift s, and ggodin seems to agree with my statement. my point was that it wasn't worth getting this software for work-related purposes because the graphics were too bad. this is not a knock on the program, this is a knock on the hardware used and a message to others who might be in the same situation as myself. my workaround for this was that one might be able to use the vive pro, but as i have never used it i would not be a reliable source.

i hope this explains my review and if there are any further points of clarification required, feel free to message me and i will explain myself.",1566353036,3,7,442494

"i'm a new quester and being a longtime ""exorcist"" film fan, i was going to wait until october to purchase this game series. but then, a few days ago, it was available¨Cfeatured as the daily deal on sale in the oculus store and i had to purchase it.

as soon as i entered the game, i truly felt like i was lt. kinderman (a mix of both lee j. cobb & george c. scott). before i began my journey, i was hoping to witness something ""blatty style"" in the form of a spider walk, headspin, or a ceiling crawl. and with the latter, i did, a few chapters in. and it was oh-so satisfying to see and experience. 

is it scary? i'm sure it is for many, but since i'm a longtime horror fan, the jumps and scares were awesome, but for me, personally, they were more of thrills and chills as it takes a lot to scare me, much like the 1974 film did when i was a child when seeing it for the first time (r-rated.)  but, there was one moment that caught me off guard¨Ca very scary surprise that did make me jump and gasp out loud in which i lost my breath. and that was in chapter 5 when revisiting father bell's office once again. the quick charge. the knockdown. that was great. and the entire quick segment of bell's office having the classic 'exorcist' chamber-of-horrors elements had me wanting more. 

i also loved how the game paid homage to the first and third films, especially with pazuzu, the mention of father morning, and the gemini killer! i encourage the developers to continue this series further, maybe in the form of other leading characters and locales. and from the films, there are so many side stories and locales that could be pivotal storytellers for that continuing series. perhaps a prequel or even again, a modern-day sequel taking us back to georgetown to the infamous ""m"" street steps and the former rented, mcneil home.

"let me start of by clarifying something, i've played pretty much every generation of this classic. i only missed the gamecube original because i was too young at the time but from the smooth playing wii version to the beautiful hd re release i love this game, that's why i can say that this version is amazing! the new perspective makes the classic environments feel new again and actually facing your enemies is much more terrifying when they are literally in your face and it feels more challenging not having the usual third person perspective your used too, this can be good and bad, good because it makes things harder for veterans but bad when your being overwhelmed when you have several enemies and some random ranged enemy kills you from behind because your eyes and ears are focused somewhere else. things aren't perfect though, first the small stuff.. the controls. i play seated and i find myself grabbing my ammo way more then i should be, specifically when i'm reaching to grab some ammo that an enemy dropped in the middle of an encounter and i end up grabbing a new clip.... which empties your current clip leaving you defenseless as for some reason that ejects your current clip... even though there's a dedicated button to do so! then there's the qtes, anyone who's played any iteration of re4 knows about the many quick time event that litter the game, for the most part they work fine but then we get to the triggers.... the game describes the qte's as either doing motions or ""buttons"" but you'll never press a button you'll pull both triggers! i died way to much in qte's then i should have because it gave me a motion i didn't recognize untill more then half way through the game and that was squizzing both triggers. hope that's saves some deaths for some of you that read this far. but the big issue is the lack of the iconic extra modes from the original. i get not having separate ways or operation ada as those are beefy additions but not having mercinaries is criminal! those that havnt played it let me explain, it's an arcade like side mode that has you killing as many enemies in a set arena as possible with combos adding additional points as you scramble for ammo, healing items and additional and ""bonus"" time to increase your score and help unlock additional characters (loadouts) for mercinaries and unlockables for the main game, missing this mode just hurts as vr is perfect for it! if they eventually add this mode (and the other two) then i will quickly change to a perfect ten, untill then i can only say that the wii port is superior, this is a system seller but it's missing the full experience... literally almost perfect!",1666547220,5,Thank you so much for your review.

the game is fun, period.  rubber ducky/10

best single player campaign i have played yet on vr. i was lucky and got a great person to play the co-op campaign and it was the most fun i had in vr with another player yet. 

the story is simple, short, funny, and at times intense.

don't let the blink movement keep you from playing, it is done well and works well as a mechanic when dealing with zombies. there was thought put into the movement, and when you get surrounded you will understand it. no cheap stuff here.

graphics are smooth and polished, it looks nice and functions well.

like most of the vr games, multiplayer can be sparse at times. but if you patient or lucky, multiplayer is really fun. especially the co-op.

i can't say much on the i5 issues as i have an i7, and don't know much about what's going on during the writing of this. so not knowing much outside of my game play, i would say i really enjoy this game.

i crave more, and more cool people to play co-op with.

"i feel like people are going nuts over the idea of a vr mmorpg and people that use vr are so desperate for content that they'll eat anything up.

zenith is not a bad vr game but by pc flatscreen mmo standards it's pretty much like a 10-15 years old korean free to play mmorpg and not even a good one. it's also not in a very good state right now in terms of polish. i have had multiple glitches and issues like falling through the floor and quest markers showing up on map that have no quests. i also constantly do actions that i didn't intend because the floating items and weapons are constantly in the way and spell registration is very hit and miss. tutorials for godstones and cooking are either terrible or don't seem to exist. the game is in a very sorry and broken state right now.

the content is also very lacking right now. you have long gaps between the main story quests where you are just left to run around the world collecting experience by doing grind quests. the story is also of very little impact. it's just a empty reason to take you on a trek across the map. there's also very low amount of notable group content or any ""fun"" content for that matter. the game is 95% just ""go there"", ""kill x amount of enemies"", ""collect y amount of things""

i really want to like zenith and i feel like the developers are very passionate and communicative that this is not the state that they want the game to end up in. it's also currently marked as early access on steam but not on oculus. i like the idea of zenith and i like the direction that it seems to be heading in but as a product to consider buying right now for its current merits and content i have a very hard time recommending it. especially hard to recommend on oculus where it's not even marked as ""early access"" for whatever weird meta policy reason.",1644150000,5, ,283333
"lonn is an awesome cyberpunk themed vr action game with parkour, story and exploration elements. i haven't completed the story yet, but i am quite far in and find it's extremely well-produced, especially after the updates that were added. however, there are some gameplay and control elements that could do with some tweaking. initially, i found issue with climbing when seated using a hp reverb g2, but i believe this is more to do with my calibration whilst seated rather than the game. i have got a lot better at it now. 

 i especially enjoy the new bounty mode though, which i've completed once (it's procedural generated so you can replay again-and-again).  there is a learning curve here and i would say the story does start off pretty slow-paced but continues to get better as you progress. 

nice visuals, cool combat and a decent story make this a must have vr title in my opinion. i also hope the developers add more to the bounty mode.

"i would like this game more if the pace fit the level of time spent in the game. once you leave the main building, you end up being dropped in the ""thick"" of battle and the zombies aren't nearly as bad as the bandits (who have guns) are you you're taking on both with a group who mostly has......handguns? and they can't even reload themselves? i got into this game to shoot, not play ""god"" and have to spend all my time worrying about building.

there is a big ""bug"" in the game. the guys, heading to whatever place, can't shoot on the way. well, they can after they get there? do they pull guns out of their anuses after they get there? i mean, i'm just saying. these guys get slaughtered (by bandits) ""on the way"" to defend and don't stand a chance. i see that as either a defect in programming or a bug. 

no matter how much i upgraded their firepower,. they got overrun. the grenade launcher upgrade did nothing (there were no explosions after i added it) so what, is it a possession-only upgrade? i mean, the zombies aren't really anything but the bandits are way too hard to kill.

this game lacks a ""balance"" between the lack of power the zombies have and the over-power of the bandits.",1543824362,0,0,579682

"i got this game as soon as i bought my cv1. even tho it's kind of giving up on me , i still play this game very often , even without multiplayer (yet.).

vtolvr has been one of the best vr experiences i've played. me being a regular dcs vr pilot. i thought i could never bring my physical hands (or well , controllers but close enough.) into any flight game , which kind of made me sad... but then our lord paolo appeared in my recommended list on youtube with a  vtolvr pre-prototype video. i was astonished , and imediately jumped on the project. even tho it might not be the most acurate flight sim , you feel like a god damn flyboi when you just literally move your arm physically to interact with something in your cockpit , and that feeling is nowhere to be seen in any other flight game.

in vtolvr , you have 3 aircrafts (at the time of my review.)

av-42c ---

the av-42c is a light attack aircraft or gunship , capable of doing infantry transport. sexy beast , but hope you don't get in bfms with it.

f/a 26b ---

carrier base f-15c mixed with a f-22 and f/a 18 (cursed but it looks damn sexy.)

f-45a ---

literally a f-35 with stealth features (internal hardpoints and more). and man why you gotta add the canard >:(((




the developer(s) are also an amazing part of vtolvr. they have a discord where the dev(s) actively speak with the community , does bugfixes , receives suggestion and feedback and even more stuff. yes , i said ""another game dev that actually listens to the community????!!!"" which results in bug getting fixed not even a few hours after discovery (if the dev is awake , everyone has to sleep.)


that pretty much makes it for my review. thanks for reading , and thank you so much paolo for giving us this master piece of a game. the future is bright for it , and i can't wait to see it.



10/10 , if you got some spare money , go for it my friend.

one shooting with a pistol for example is always fun and dropping heavy items from high up areas trying to make em land on the enemy never gets old. so whilst i know i haven't said much about the game, please do buy it you wont be disappointed and if you do i'll get you a cookie the next time i see you too.",1713660888,0,,163276956
"prison boss game is an arcade simulation about crafting things from ur prison cell and selling it to get more money, more materials, more crafting, and eventually get u out of ur jail.

basically, the gameplay is like this :
u always start with some basic materials, u craft at night in hidden while the guards patrolling around, and then u sell the products at morning.
with the money u have, u will buy more materials (materials have their own limits everyday), and craft more.
the gameplay become more complex because u have to choose between selling ur products, or dedicate them for jobs u get from ur inmate and increase ur reputation, or unlock more materials or appliances.
u can buy more shelves, cupboards, lamps, and even posters to decorate ur cells, and for more space to store ur materials and products.

there are lots of materials and products and appliances to make the games even more interesting, and would need u to plan and strategizing to be more efficient, as even though money is important, but ur main mission is to gain more reputation, and eventually got out of jail.

it took me about 10 hours to finished all 4 jails. yes there are 4 jails for all, a boss mode (which means custom mode, u choose starting craft, unlock items along the way and try to get as much money as possible), and an arcade mode (time mode, which u try to get as much crafting as possible in 3 minutes, and every crafting finished would extend the time limit).

it's an addictive game if u like crafting and paving ur way from zero to hero.

well, onto the minus :
- u need enough game space to play this as there's no movement (not even teleport), so u need a room as much as the size of the cell. my space is about 2x2.5 m and i still occasionally hit the wall

ps :
if u feels the game is lagging a lot, try to see the options on steamvr.
this game is lagging the 1st time i try it and i almost gave up on it. but then i found that the game is set on very high resolution on steamvr. i reduced it and now the game is smooth enough. it still lag on the arcade (not the story mode), but i'd deal with it later (maybe reduced more resolution?), as i'm still enjoying playing the story mode.",1609722031,0,0,683008

- fun way to do cardio

"my original review was 1 star as the game would not save progress across both the quest 2 and rift versions.  the developers replied to me that they fixed the issue, and i finally had enough time to play the game start to finish this past week.

the only experience i have with warhammer (talking only about 40k in this specific review, but have played multiple fantasy games as well) is their video games.  space marine, deathwing, etc are all of the lore and world building i know.  i however absouletly love the 40k setting, and it fasincates me.  i think the environments look pretty great honestly, considering this was seemingly developed as a quest game first.  i am very grateful i waited for the pcvr version of the game, as i played it at 1.4x quest 2 resolution and 120hz and it looked and played great (9900k, rtx2080, 32gb ddr4).  i encountered a few bugs here and there, but most of the time had a smooth experience throughout the campaign.  i only had to manually restart to a checkpoint once in the penultimate level, as i teleported beyond a barrier i wasn't supposed to.  

the battle sisters are a really cool part of the universe that i'm glad i got to meet, but would have loved to had them fleshed out a bit more.  this leads to the first of my only two issues with the game.  its not quite long enough.  i actually don't know how many hours it was start to finish, but i felt some of the deaths and twists in the games would have had much more impact had we gotten to know the characters involved much more thoroughly.  however, this being a vr game and knowing that games are very expensive to make these days, i understand.

my other issue is with the boss fights.  the levels themselves can be very hard, and take a bit of strategy and fast thinking.  the bosses however are very easy, and quite anti climactic (especially the final boss).

overall i'm glad i got to play througn it!",1627183414,5,"Dear Ultimeas,

i play with my oculus touch controllers and voice attack with orion (william shatner's voice). it took a while to set up the controllers with key bindings that worked for me, but once i figured it out, the game becomes immersive. excellent game.",1521429814,5, ,359029
"i just want to start out by saying that i have really enjoyed this game for the 25 hours that i have played so far. to be honest, i forgot that it was in early access since it has more content, and is more polished than most games now days or at least it felt like it to me lol. the devs are great and the community is even better! any time that i needed help with a boss, or a raid someone was always willing to jump in to help me out. i finished the main story and 100% the game on steam which was fun. if this was a normal mmo as many said it probably would have been written off but the additional complications of developing something like this in vr makes it truly stand out. i really like where the game is headed. the more vr games i play, the more i realize that this really is one of the best games on the market for the genre. 

however i do have complaints, the music is kind of bland, the game can ocassionally be buggy, and the late game areas do not feel like they have gotten much love in comparison to the very good starting areas. a lot of the quests can be repetitive and lack variety however i still had fun with the game. i met a lot of cool people and fully intend to play this even more as additional content is added! i highly reccomend this game and would say it is worth full price!",1669410462,0,,126884692

i hit my hand on the wall while playing,1624324149,0,0,419997
"i spent more time trying to get this thing working right than i did actually watching the video.  

what went wrong?  well i don't know if this is on valve, on me somehow, or the devs, but the developers set ""grip"" to mean ""exit video, return to menu"".  why? who would want that to be an exit trigger??  i guess that part is the developer's fault.  valve's part is that the default grip sensitivity is way too high, so you can accidentally trigger the exit by just putting your hand on the controller, or wiggling your hand once it's in the controller, or resting your fingers on the grip slightly.   

once i located the steam settings to edit the grip sensitivity, i fixed that issue, but it's still annoying and i've never had an issue before today.  so i finally get to watch for more than 1 minute of video! yay.

the second problem is that the developers wanted this to be really dramatic so they whip you around wildly for no good reason other than ""ha ha! we control the horizontal! we control the vertical!"" and i've got a strong stomach and my vr legs but it was on the verge of making me feel ill.   they could have moved you at a constant rate and it would have been fine but no, let's pretend the viewer is on the end of a rope as we swing it around the room instead!  dramatic!

it would be bad enough if they did that once but just about any turn you make in the video is the same way, like riding a roller coaster sideways (except nowhere near as much fun).  if all of this sounds bad though...well, keep in mind the entire thing is 10 minutes long (maybe 15?) and so you could potentially buy it, watch it once and get all the ""fun"" out of it, and then refund it.    i'm not going to do that, but imagine if you felt ripped off at how short it was?  you might be tempted.

anyway, so they really wanted morgan freeman to narrate this, but instead they got morgman freegan.    they got the wish.com version of morgan freeman.  they should have opted for gordon freeman instead.  i don't think the narration was all that great.  it's been more than 10 minutes since i watched it and i can't really remember much of anything that the celebrity impersonator said.  

several times they show an image of the planet alongside an ""earth for scale"" type image, and it really looks so flat that it doesn't adequately convey the difference in size.  you could be looking at the earth up close compared to the planet or you could be looking at the earth far away.  they could have done a much better job.

oh and i know that pluto got demoted, but these guys totally ignored pluto...didn't even give it a mention.  they talked about enceladus though.  6th largest moon of saturn gets a whole segment, and pluto doesn't even show up on the radar.  nice.

i'm unlikely to ever go back to watch this again, and i'd say unless you've got money burning a hole in your pocket and/or the thing is on sale for under $1 then don't bother.  try ""titans of space plus"" instead.  it's much better.

the good:
-combat: one of a kind, whether it is slicing enemies or throwing fireballs at them, it makes me keep coming back for more every time, and with the freedom this game gives the player on how they want to conquer a situation gives players room to experiment with builds and playstyles
-graphics: stunning graphics for a vr game, maybe not photorealistic but the graphics are amazing, which pair well with my next point
-the world: eraden is a place with many stunning locations, from green hills to mountains, i could never get bored of the beautiful surroundings as i murder people
-crystal hunt: my biggest criticism with blade and sorcery before 1.0 was how there were no goal to try to achieve, but this gamemode scratches my itch for it
-mods: the modding community is a big part of this game, adding all new fun ways to kill people with weapons and spells, to new set-locations to fight. one of the highlights of this entire game as a whole

the not-so good:
-brain-dead ai: ever since blade and sorcery existed, the ai always felt dumb (because they were), which makes them mainly just sitting targets occasionally hitting you
-framerate: one side effect of having the graphics being beautiful is the sounds of your pc not sounding beautiful, i run a 3070ti with a amd ryzen 5 5600x and get frame drops within fights, but it really isn't nothing too big none the less

*there are some spelling mistakes (or are they?) in there that brings down the professionalism of the game as an english release - such as; ""original cracks 1"" instead of 'original tracks, vol. 1' - but that's just been nitpicky, and is a largely forgiveable flaw given the current small state of the market meaning it's often difficult to justify additional professional translation expenses.

currently features 6 tracks and 3 difficulties for each. pleasant asian pop music (the game is made by a chinese developer).

the beats are hand crafted (which is a vitally important point of difference from more procedurally oriented beat/rhythm games) allowing the gameplay to be a lot more interesting and dynamic feeling (as in the transitions between each beat feel a lot more interesting and challenging).

the only flaw is not really its fault - it's the lack of tactile feedback. i found that while standing, i'd slowly drift downwards as the game got more and more intense, so i had to pull up a chair which allowed me to be more consistent.

it is a fairly hard game though... difficult ramps up quickly, and by the end of the first song on basic mode, you're already approaching the difficulty level found on moderate hard songs in medium to hard difficulty in rockband/guitar hero (although it's been a while since i played those games).

"i was a pretty big fan of fallout 4 and recently obtained a vr headset, so this seemed like a natural purchase for me. this is the second game i've ever refunded.

design-wise it seemed to do a pretty good job of adapting fallout 4 into a more vr friendly experience. you can't pick objects up directly but instead use interactions similar to fallout 4 (pointing at it and holding down a button) to move them around which didn't really surprise me because it seems like an engine limitation. i was a little disappointed by the lack of character creation (you only choose a preset instead of the full character customization) but that's more of a nitpick than a knock against it - after all it's vr, you're not going to see yourself at all.

i had a difficult time managing the controls of the game which were fairly complex and there just wasn't enough customization for me to be able to use them effectively. the game lets you choose your weapon hand for things like shooting and swinging melee attacks, but your walking movement is handled by one hand and your turning is done with the other. i'm cross-dominant (meaning my dominant hand varys for different tasks) and splitting the movement across my hands made it difficult for me to manage walking around the space most of the time, especially when it required me to both move and shoot at the same time. i certainly don't expect everyone to have a problem like this but it was a pretty big inhibiting factor in learning the controls for me. combat seemed to function as-expected from what i experienced but yeah, control customization would have gone a long way for me.

my biggest problems were technical. despite fallout 4 load times taking maybe 15 seconds tops on my pc for the regular game, fallout vr's load times were rarely shorter than a minute for me, especially when it loaded to the main menu - which i had to do a lot while i was troubleshooting the game's eggregious stutter problems.

whatever stuttering problem i had, it was game-breaking. every couple seconds the framerate tanked and the game would studder which not only made playing incredibly hard but also gave me a tremendous headache after playing for a while. i found very few solutions online (i tried a lot) and ended up having to refund the game as this stutter got exponentially worse once i left the starting area.


if fallout 4 is your first vr experience: there are better (and cheaper) vr experiences.

if you've never played fallout 4: buy the standard version and play that one. 

if you've played fallout 4 and want to experience it in vr: be ready to troubleshoot your experience.",1516227692,3,0,602135

"this ""game"" really demonstrates what vr can be used for, beyond just porting games from 2d platforms. the world is very convincing, but woefully underused. scary? yup. but keep in mind, i'm in my 50s. and, each ""episode"" is only 5 bucks. now for the gripes: the story moves way too fast. i realize that right now, there is very little profit being made from vr, because that vast market of ""gamers"" out there just don't like vr, especially considering how much a rig costs. 100s of millions of people grew up with xbox style controllers in their hands, and vr is just too different. it's going to the same way games did--a whole new generation of kids will have to grow up with it. and, of course, most people get motion sickness really bad at first. (pro tip: notice that, in the real world, you ""blink"" all the way through any movement of your head. your brain doesn't know it's supposed to do that in vr, so you need to develop that habit again. i've had vr for over a year now, but most people need to try it over and over again until they get comfortable. and that's not exactly a selling point.) sooooooooo, games that take too long to play don't sell well at all yet. but this game will really be everything it can be when it takes a little more time to build up suspense. what do i mean? well, for example, in the first episode, it's just too obvious too soon that something totally supernatural is going on. but i also understand that the market right now pretty much ""forces"" developers to do that.

"i have no problems with virtual desktop besides one
when the update is available on oculus since i downloaded the virtual desktop on my pc from the virtual desktop website they update at different times
last time this happened not including right now 
virtual desktop updated on my quest a few weeks before the update was available on my pc so they were two different versions therefor they couldnt connect
i asked oculus customer support a few times if reverting an update is available which it isnt
which is a problem for me since i play pc vr daily on vrchat to hangout with friends
im autistic and the physics give me a sense of reality in the game
without physics aka being on quest is a big sensory issue for me so having this issue happen 3 times in only a few months since i got virtual desktop around november-december 2021
this issue has stressed me out to try and fix
uninstalling and reinstalling virtual desktop on my pc doesnt help either
it just makes me wait until the pc version updates a few weeks later
its annoying

"it wants to be good. it isn't yet. going from blade & sorcery to boneworks to bonelab feels like a regression. there's more jank in the physics, the guns aren't as satisfying, and its less that the language of the game has changed and more that they've simply redefined terms. 

i was attempting the parkour map and it was brutal. double tap to run is still videogamey and awkward, but the worst was the jank. the amount of times that either my hands got trapped in terrain or obstacles i let go of had some how gotten entangled was frustrating to no end. given that it dropped yesterday, i'm sure there'll be qol patches and mods. but as of right now, this game is more frustrating than fun.",1664583432,0,,123108099

"while this game is not the first vrmmo as people wrongfully assume, it is the first vrmmo to my knowledge that uses anime stylings to entice people into playing a rather bare-bones mmo experience (however is first impressions from my first 5 hours, the map looks to be very big, but the limited play styles might make the grind into a chore, plus there is next to no buildcrafting to my knowledge.). there are two classes, and combat is okay for a mmo set in vr. 

you can climb and fly places, but the world itself does not seem to really be made for climbing or flying, it feels very tacked on and a afterthought posed as a main feature.

all i can say is that it plays like a generic theme park mmo with a confused world. i have no idea what the theme is as its rather inconsistent. i wanna say its akin to final fantasy's mix of technology and mysticism. its a okay looking game, im sure being on playstation and quest is the reason the world is so graphically limited. it is still a very pretty game.

another thing to note, you hold items like the knife for cooking, or your swords even very strangely. i am also assuming thats because of playstations controllers, but it feels very unpolished seeing my swords float in the middle of my hand.

 as it stands still, orbusvr is still the most fleshed out vrmmo with more interesting and varied combat that is tailored for vr controls. however, alot of people do not like orbus's artstyle, i'm sure if it was anime it would be king. i really do hope that zenith gets fantastic updates over the course of its existence, but as someone who has played mmorpgs for thousands and thousands of hours in the course of my life, i have to be very critical. and so far, its unimpressive from  a mmo standpoint, and only gets points as its in vr on multiple platforms. hopefully we can see more vrmmo's in the future.

6/10 i think is a good score for it.

so far what needs to be addressed is the frame rate issue. i get lots of stuttering in the game, and the longer you play the game, the worse it gets. i'm running a 2080 gpu, so i guess it's another optimization issue. i hope the developers are working on getting a new update for this that fixes a bunch of problems, because this is one of the better vr games out there, and at a great price too. i highly recommend for those wondering. sure, it has it's issues now, but the small indie developers are working on the psvr port as well as the pc version at the same time, so give them some slack.

"this game is a joke.  granted it's only $7 right now, but for just about $1 more you could get a game like bullets and more, that is literally 10+ times the size of this game and is actually done well.  i appreciate the dev's attempt at this game, but it's a swing and a miss in my opinion.  

here is a list of things i didn't like about the game: game mechancis like reloading are horrible (the gun practically has to give birth to the magaine to eject it), there actually might be no locomotion or control options whatsoever (i couldn't find any), only 2 of the 6 or 7 levels actually let you walk around (extremely slowly), the missions are dumb, pointless, and boring as hell, and the only reason there even are that many maps is because some are day and some are night but they're the same boring maps, what tiny little amounts of story there are make no sense whatsoever, the game is stupid easy (unlocked all weapons in 3 games and never died once), the dev obviously knows very little about guns because the weapon mechanics are wrong on some of the weapons (example: mk18 charging handle kicks back with every shot lmfao), none of the weapons i used kicked at all (assuming none do), so even though you can 2-hand a rifle, there's no point, the weapon sights are horrible (like looking at little lcd screens with a reticle painted on, instead of an actual sight), there is very little attention to detail in the majority of the game (especially the ""operation trailer"" or whatever it is where you spawn into the wall if you're standing in the middle of your play space, the weapon scale looks wrong for some guns in the operations trailer (although i didn't handle every weapon because this game can't keep my attention that well), weapon options are very limited (i think there were 6 guns), the operations trailer has all sorts of weird invisible surfaces that not only look crappy but also make launching the mission annoying. 

things i liked about the game:  the 1911 sound is pretty good

all in all, i definitely don't recommend this game, especially considering what other games are out there for a similar price.  if you want to do some hardcore zombie slaying buy dead effect (all zombie slaying) or bullets and more (includes zombie slaying).

to the dev:  i'm not going to ask you for a refund because it seems you probably need my $7 more than i do.  however, if you would like some advice on how to make your game astronomically better, start by addressing the thigns i've listed here.  when you complete that, let me know and i will find more things for you to fix in your game.  lol",1498326369,2,0,517629
"[h1] william wallace simulator [/h1]

awesome game. the physics of combat threw me off at first. coming from blade & sorcery, i was quite used to just holding my weapon in place if i wanted to block an attack, or slicing through the opponents with little to no difficulty. i couldn't make sense of what was happening and watched all the devs (and others) game play videos where they were playing as if conan himself. the answer was simple. handle your weapons and body movements like you would in a real fight. and that was it....it was epic.

like others have said, this is like being in an actual mount & blade game, having mass battles and action going on all around you. fans of the m&b games should feel right at home with the campaign, though i've spent most of my time in the arena and procedural dungeons learning to fight multiple enemies solo. armour actually means something in this game, so you best go for those weak spots against the tanky opponents. if archery is your thing, it's pretty accurate and satisfying in this game too. charge about on your horse if you prefer...it has it all.

playing on the oq2, with a 2080ti and 9900k@(5ghz), the performance has been really good too so far. even in mass battles. like tog2, you can tweak the ai numbers and graphical settings to suit your hardware.

"stride has been suffering from over-pandering to the quest for a while. there was an update that took multiple more months to come to pc after it was released for the quest for one example.

stride: fates is another example of that. not only problems caused from the quest but also ai slop too. also many other problems unrelated to either.

the quest limited the scope of what this game could of been graphically and with it's way too linear level design.
there's also a bunch of ai usage within the game which ain't to great.

and overall just a bunch of issues otherwise including...

the screenshots on the steam page are literally a complete fucking lie. very much just concept art pasted onto the page.

the story is an absolute mess. characters come and go throughout a radio randomly multiple times never to appear or be mentioned again after one transmission. really bad dialogue. really bad world building. really bad ending twist that is just dumb. i could go on and on. i really did not expect much and i still am disappointed. it's not like mirror's edge had an amazing story, but it was serviceable and i didn't hear a bunch of yapping in my ear all the time.

movement just feels like an overall downgrade from the original stride somehow. due to the nature of having options to choose if you want to armswing for more speed or not it seemed to cause issues with armswinging related mechanics. running takes less effort to do along with larger jumps not needing as big of armswings which hurts immersion. i was covered in sweat after my first game session of stride, i felt nothing here. grappling, wallrunning feel about the same but ziplines have the same issue that was in stride. ziplines don't ease in with speed, it's constant which just feels fake along with an instant loss of speed as soon as you let go. stride originally had you gain speed on a zipline and allowed you to make great leaps by keeping your momentum from that speed in the air but they removed that in an update which did suck. grabbing the environment feels worse too, can't really explain how here, just feels that way.

combat is a janky mess. blunt melee and hand to hand just feels weak and sluggish taking way to long to kill. (i also swear their glasses used to break when you punched someone in the face in this game when it launched on the quest, where'd that go?) guns just feel very meh. i have accidentally grabbed magazines out from my ammo supply multiple times with no way to put it back onto them thus wasting that ammo. enemies feel fairly boring to fight as well. the knife feels pretty decent tho, don't mind that when it works.

the way you upgrade weapons also is fucking awful and ruins the game flow. you have to collect scattered weapon upgrade parts in the levels but it means you are gonna have to slow down to an absolute halt to do so. there is even hl:a styled hacking sections and just fucking why??? it worked there for being a slower game that had multiple puzzles throughout its runtime but it doesn't work in whats meant to be a very fast-paced game.

"at first i didn't understand why there were only 3 levels and why death was guaranteed every time. i quickly figured out that beating the levels is not even half the battle; the achievements you earn are what keeps you playing over and over again. the satisfying click sound when an achievement is earned is great, especially when you've been chasing it for a long time.  you could probably play 50 hours without unlocking all the achievements. some seem unreachable at first, but your skill level will improve and make them obtainable. some achievements you must focus on, giving up on the others that might contradict your goal. 

also, if you are able to beat all three levels, you continue at the beginning again, but all the monsters are faster and harder to kill - the game continues to match your own skill level and keep you challenged no matter how good you get.

the short, stationary levels that they just added (with more promised) are equally addictive, but for different reasons. basically, you have to kill hordes before they get through a gate and it gets pretty intense.

if you beat all the levels and get 100% of the achievements, then you can still challenge yourself by trying to climb the worldwide points leaderboards, or switch weapons and start over (bow and crossbow).

so here is my take on this amazing game!

pros
- great variety of songs
- stunning visuals
- great gadgets and instruments to play with

cons
- can't adjust volume for most of the instruments except for the looper.
- when using the arrangment cube, you can't add a certain section of the song. you have to use the default presets.
- the sequencer is way too short and it gets very annoying to hear the 6-12 notes all the time. a longer sequencer opens up to more creativity. if someone doenst want to use a long sequencer they can just repeat the notes they want. 

100% fun all and all. love it!",1575488340,0,0,686603

"a game with short term appeal, but not much long-term value

what we have here is a starship troopers first-person shooter, that despite appearances, is largely a wave-based shooter with locomotion.  the game is geared more towards multi-player (up to 2 vs 2) over what seems to be 2 large levels (with both day and night variants), so anybody looking for a story will need to look elsewhere.  any single player aspects are mostly regulated to bot matches, although they seem to have added a co-op sandbox mode. the pro and cons are as follows:

pros:
- overall graphical presentation is solid, and the levels generally have a wide-open, halo-like feel to them (only a little corridor-type play).  the provided levels are very epic in scope.
- for locomotion/smooth turning fans, all of your basic needs are covered here.  you even have a useful teleport option to get you to places where locomotion can't.  both locomotion and teleport are simultaneously provided to the user.
- the weapons are largely recycled assets from farhome, but i enjoyed how the weapons felt/handled/looked in farhome, so i have no complaints here.

cons:
- some graphics/enemies seem to be recycled from a prior game from this developer (farhome), so any remaining farhome fans may notice the game does not feel entirely original.
- in some instances, the teleport feature is more useful than the locomotion.  for example, when trying to get away from enemies, teleporting does it much faster than locomotion (which does not feel right to me).
- the overall game mode is you racing to the end of a level against another another player/bot that i don't think you ever see (because you are on the other side of the course).  all you have is an indicator that tells you what stage they are on versus you. this presentation saps any fun for myself from the experience because you never to see, or directly fight against your true opponent (the bugs are largely obstacles in your way). some kind of direct, competitive interaction against the human player/bot is needed here (or give a story element as to why you are fighting against the bugs).
- while the training level got me familiar with the game mechanics, it seems to be largely based on the farhome training level.  however, i feel the training level in farhome is better (this is purely personel preference, but the in-game video of how the weapons worked was a really nice touch).
- to date, i have yet to run into another human player.  granted, i play late at night on the us east coast when time allows, but after a couple of weeks of playing against yourself or a bot, the game loses its appeal from a single player perspective.
- the amount of grinding you will have to do to level up your character/weapons would be more fun with a human player, but when it is just you, it eventually becomes a chore.  i finally got to level 3, and my first thought was, 'i won't have the strength to make to level 10 by myself'.
- the weapons have a lovely holographic sight, but i find no reason to ever use it (e.g., a mission where sniping a enemy from afar is needed, or firing at a precise weak point in a structure to bring it down on your enemies). two-handed firing is practically useless, unless to change to the secondary firing mode; firing single-handed with the rifle works fine 90% of the time.

while the recent update helped in some areas (i think the enemy ai got better in some areas), the cons listed above already started to surface after going through a few skirmishes.
the primary appeal of this game for myself was to see if this was a spiritual successor in some way to farhome (which i enjoyed very much, despite its being left unfinished after its initial release), and there is some goodness to be found here, but being forced to a nearly non-existent single-player mode in a predominately multi-player game is draining any joy away. 

with a 'healthy' user base, this game would be great for a pick up match here and there, but unless there are some more levels coming, or a single player mode start to emerge, the length between 'here' and 'there' is likely to increase.",1561303575,3,0,370815

"and it helps that archery is intrinsically so much better-suited to motion controls than anything melee. a great design choice from the start to be archery-only, right down to the teleportation method, and aided by the christian-mythological ""purgatory"" setting and atmosphere suited to a roguelike, evoking very 12th-century themes of melancholy bow-wielding angels against the somber darkness.

especially helpful is the variety of enemy behaviors, compared to similar experiences. while the ai is by no means sophisticated, the design here does not allow the player to become complacent. around the next corner could just as well be a hooded archer that will teleport around as if mocking the player themself, a leaping zombie-ghoul thing that will have you anxiously flinching whenever it draws too close, or a helmeted axe-wielding knight that can simply chop through any of your defenses.

the early access state is most apparent in how objects are generated into the procedural levels, currently often misaligned with the walls they're supposed to be attached to. but thankfully, these are all decorative objects suffering such problems and not anything mechanically significant.

one criticism i would have is of the controls when it comes to interacting with menus, using the trigger to select menu items. this is a problem across vr generally, that some developers use the trigger and others the a button. as usual, my suggestion would be to just use both. since the a button doesn't do anything else in menus already, why not respond the same way to both.",1521170614,5, ,336196

"this game is great and is easily one of my favourite vr games/apps. the developers have put in a lot of careful work on to all of the courses and work to continue to provide new courses and updates on a fairly regular basis. the game currently contains 6 courses of 18 holes, however each course also has a ??ard??mode that you can unlock which takes the total to 12 lots of 18 (that?? 216 holes!!). each of them have the distinctive feel of a true mini golf course and every course offers it?? own little themes and quirks that make them all feel distinctive and make them a joy to revisit and replay. 

the overall course design is also fantastic. the holes are carefully laid out and the environment is built brilliantly around them. you can stand at the top of a hill and overlook holes you haven?? yet played and if you choose to you can manually navigate between holes rather than just teleporting straight to the next shot which adds to the experience. this is also actively encouraged with ??ost balls??hidden on each hole for  the player to find and add to their collection. i think the devs made a good choice with the animation and textures as you get the vibe and the sense of it being a real course whilst not feeling that the game is trying too hard to be something it?? not. 

the game play is responsive and as other reviews have mentioned it is actually quite easy to believe you are playing a real mini golf shot as the game has a fairly realistic feel in terms of feedback and responsiveness. the only slight criticism i have comes from the fact the balls feel a little too bouncy so this can make any holes with drops or gaps to jump hard to judge. but it?? a minor issue. overall the game plays really really well. 

having multiplayer is an added bonus that just tops it off and this would be perfect with a group of friends. i can?? wait for more courses and if any devs are reading i?? love to see further personalisation and customisation added alongside the balls in terms of new clubs, new flag poles, new golf visors for your character in multiplayer? that would be awesome.

to round things up, this is an excellent game that is well worth its fairly cheap price tag and i could not recommend it enough.",1661858400,5, ,200107
"
the game feels very cheap.  

for me the worst part is the general cheap look and presentation like the main menu, intros, everything.  i could go with a decend 2d menu, but as is it just looks like ""tried and failed"". 

another big dissapointment are the controls. in a game that does nothing but simulate a heli, i would at least hope that you can control it properly. yes, i understand the controls, dont answer with that lowkey video, but they are just bad to use. 

and however, i woulread mored rather hope for the motion controllers being used. why use gamepad-like control when it should be in vr and somehow tracking hand movement.

this is a very solid game and offers 360 immersion in the game.  it's not just look forward and shoot or throw.  you have to look all around and above you on some levels.  if you can't find the target...look up!

"[h1]vr? ? dungeon? ? knight? ?[/h1]
vr dungeon knight is a straight up dungeon crawler in vr the way you¡¯d expect it and want it to be. 
you go through a set of randomly generated dungeons, killing enemies collecting gold/ health from crates, fight the mini boss and get to the end of the dungeon for your reward. 
there are two different difficulties, normal and extreme. the only difference being the amount of enemies that spawn and the amount of damage they deal. 
there are two main bosses to fight, the sorcerer and the spider (hidden boss). the sorcerer was part of the main dungeon but it seems like they have changed that now and its part of a separate room that you just access whenever you want now which i don¡¯t mind.

what makes this game fun is how the weapons handle and the combat. fighting an orc with a sword and shield feels really fluid and rewarding as well as blocking in coming arrows from a skeleton archer. 
there are also flintlock guns, bows, crossbows and magic stuff. 

there are no real classes, you can pick and choose however you want to play. sword + gun? sure, gun + shield? why not. the only ""class"" based things is the type of armor you choose to buy and the points you put into your stats.

this game is also playable in co-op which is what i recommend playing it as. it can be a little confusing to get working in the beginning but the trick is to launch the game through steam vr and it will work. 

only negative to take away from this game is there is not a lot of content in the game so you have to go back and replay the same dungeons to grind for gold and weapon upgrades which is fine but after three or four runs its kinda like... ok, now wot.

"i¡¯ve been playing echo vr for a little over a month now. i originally saw it in some youtube videos and thought ¡°oh maybe it would be cool for some days when i don¡¯t feel like playing my usual games¡± and now it¡¯s basically the only game i play on my quest 2. 

the movement is brilliant, i don¡¯t get motion sick because it feels so natural. and the rest of the mechanics feel pretty intuitive. 

yes, seeing as it¡¯s free, there are certainly lots of toxic players but there are also lots of players who really love the game and try their best. 

my only real point of criticism at this moment are that since the new update, player levels are not visible anymore. and although player levels do not necessarily matter because some lower levels are really good and some higher levels are pretty bad. it does help knowing if you¡¯re playing with someone who is a high level and just pretending not to know anything or if they¡¯re actually a lower level who really doesn¡¯t and is willing to learn. 

something to possibly add would be a rematch button. if you¡¯re in a game with a good level all around, it would be nice to be able to hit a rematch button and the game would put all of you back in the same match (maybe switch the teams up sometimes but the players would be the same). just a quick way to keep on having great matches with people.

look, elite dangerous, x rebirth vr... massive vr space games, but this one... kinda figured something out. simple controls, auto-aim firing so you can have that ""space ship"" feel without needing... as someone wrote, an engineering degree. it's not that that would not be welcome, it's that sometimes you just want an immersive, simple experience. 

the potential:

it could have a richer ship with buttons to press from time to time, really, even if they were simple, like ""overheated - vent"" button, or a button to toggle radar range, something that would take your hand off from time to time off of the stick, say.

it's a very focused experience, and they've obviously put a lot of effort into making the act of hitting the ball into the wall feel good. they also do some neat vr stuff i haven't really seen before (you stay put and the arena forms around you) and take advantage of the vr medium in cool ways (you play in a 360-degree arena because a virtual ball can't smack you in the face, and it's super immersive to be surrounded like that).

To enter into the game levels, simply look at a door which is illuminated in green (red = locked) until it opens and tap the touchpad or the usual main interaction button on your remote/controller/gamepad. If the controls are indeed all unresponsive, it sounds like a technical issue that's likely local to your system - could you try restarting your phone first, also maybe try reseating the phone into your GearVR and jiggle it about a bit.

"mechanically this game should be the standard for vr games to follow. good movement, weapons work well, etc etc etc.

from a story and gameplay perspective.. hopefully they will do better in the future. 
core gameplay loop is to pick a location, go there until you are either full of salvage or finish your quest for the area, go back home, sleep, repeat with greater difficulty. doesn't matter if you only take 1/4 of your day doing what you need to in an area. doesn't matter if you accidentally go to the wrong area. all you can do is go from your base, into an area, then back. you use the salvage you get to craft items and upgrade your benches to be able to craft more items. unfortunately there isn't a whole lot of unlocks, 30 in all with a few underwhelming secret unlocks. also unfortunately all the items you make start to jam or break within one trip out. 

that might sound negative but honestly its pretty okay. while its annoying as all hell to have your gun half broken from firing one full clip, it keeps you needing to do salvage so its kind of required. what is negative is the story. the story just kinda exists. you never really make any major decisions that have any real impact on the story and your reward for finishing the game.. is pretty much just nothig of any real value and no real conclusion. life just continues for you doing the cycle except now you have no quests. 

if you just want a game that is built really well for vr and is fun mechanically then great, buy it up. if you are wanting to get it because you are a big fan of the walking dead universe and want some meaty story with meaningful choices? not so much. like a lot of vr games this one kind of lacks a lot in the content department and sells itself entirely on the mechanics. i hope if another game comes out from this developer that they do more with it now that the engine is proven.",1583537938,3,0,744271

"let me start by saying i am very nit-picky.  and cheap.  i want the absolute most bang from my buck.  i had very high expectations when i bought my oculus, and because of my high expectations, i have been dissapointed by many experiences that are out there.  many just rushed to get a game out so the developers can say they are developing vr experiences.  bad locomotion, horrible performance, clunky mechanics, or thin plots... there are a lot of them out there.

i read the reviews on this game, and felt that it was worth the try.  i feel that rpg experiences like this is where vr really sets itself apart from regular gaming.  

i was absolutley blown away from the begining.

the visuals... the sound (classical music playing in the background for a very stanley kubrick - space odyssey touch is perfect!), the mechanics, the story line... this experience (this is so much more than a game) is absolutley incredible.  the locomotion is absolutley brilliant... it truly makes you feel weightless.  

the cool part... is the little things like touching your arm to engage your plasma cutter... or touching the top of your hand to watch the scanner engage.  it's like being in an iron man suit lol.

this is very much so worth the money.  i really can't anything wrong with it.  if you're on the fench about buying it... do it.  you'll come to appreciate vr much more so once you do.  i know i did.",1555125814,5, ,328790

game also seems very well optimised. on my rig i got 88.9 average fps in the first 45 min or so, so far.

going to try some ss, game was running at 50-60% gpu use on default settings. the shadows defaulted to medium for me and i left it, there is a note beside this setting that says not all environments use dynamic shadows.

regardless of the quality of its updates and expansions, the base game for [b]beat saber[/b] is more than worth your hard earned pennies.

[h1]pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]consistent, accessible, and enjoyable exercise. an hour or playing beat saber makes me feel so much better about my day, and that sort of exercise is a perfect for shoring up your mental health as well.
[*]great base soundtrack. eventually you may get tired of it, or not.
[*]works reasonably well in a small bedroom. my airspace is over my bed, so while i can't take a single step forward, there's no risk of hitting anything other than pillows.
[*]spectacular modding community. the platform for installing and updating mods is simple and intuitive, as is the site for downloading new songs.
[*]multiplayer adds a touch of a social dynamic. reminds me of the limited interactions in journey.
[*]score tracking gives my brain numbers to improve and progress to track.
[*]best moment: trying to play eminem's rap god on ""map god"" difficulty.
[/list]

[h1]cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]the new intro ui is terrible. you don't spend much time there, so intuitive use is far more valuable than an abstract collage.
[*]multiplayer avatars are terrible if you're not the audience they were made for. they are extremely simplistic models with what appears to be very limited technical depth, so it's strange to me that the experience was made so awkward by choosing a niche style. even accepting the style, the customization options are far from impressive.
[*]multiplayer spectating is all but useless. if you fail early on, you have to wait the entire song to rejoin. i adjusted my headset and hit the menu button, auto-failing the level. i wish i could stand in front of and to the side of players at least to amuse them with flappy antics.
[*]mods break with each update, likely because they're unofficial, which is necessary to avoid licensing issues for custom songs.

"[h1]one of my top vr experiences[/h1]
played on the oculus rift cv-1, with touch controllers and an rtx 2080 ti. i actually purchased this game some time ago but held off playing it until i had a chance to upgrade my gpu. i think of myself as a vr enthusiast more than a gamer. conventional monitor games have never captured my interest. this game was made for pancake gaming and was later ported to vr. the oculus touch controllers behave more like standard game controllers. i'm accustomed to reaching out and interacting with things in vr, much as i would in the real world. the control scheme for this game took some getting used to, but i don't think the vr experience would have been improved by adding full motion controller support. to be honest, i can't think of any changes i would suggest for the vr implementation of this game.

i initially had some reservations about purchasing this, but the trailer and story seemed compelling, so i went for it. while it has stunning environments and puzzles, which i love, it also has a lot of combat; i typically prefer calm, relaxing vr experiences. fortunately, there are various options for combat difficulty. i found that i enjoyed it once i got the hang of fighting. the puzzles, environments, and story are the real driving factors. it's not primarily a combat game. the thing that most concerned me before buying it, is that this is a 3rd-person game. i wasn't sure how that would shake out in vr. when playing, i found that it feels like i am simultaneously the character and a separate person traveling with her. given the psychosis with which senua suffers, perhaps such a dissociative feeling is appropriate. with the immense efforts taken by the developers to capture psychosis in an authentic manner, it's ironic that this particular effect was probably unintentional. 

the underlying knowledge of senua's psychological struggles added another emotional layer to the game, but a lot of the hallucinations and delusions just felt like what one would expect in any game full of monsters and magic. after all, the hallmark of a ""fantasy"" story is that it breaks with reality. on some level, the player is aware that most of what is happening is only in senua's head. in the context of the game, however, her actions largely appear as rational reactions to extraordinary circumstances. i suppose this is how a psychotic person would likely perceive her own behavior. senua was a very sympathetic character, the story-telling was superb, and the voice acting was excellent. 

senua looks like an innocent young girl in the trailer, but she's about 6'3"" in vr and looks like she could take me in a fight. her size initially suprised me, but i ultimately decided that it made her physical feats more believable. the character modeling, materials, and animation are really well done. when i get up close and look at her in certain light, i feel almost like she's a real person. in-game, she actually seemed more real than in some of the cut-scenes. by the end of the game, i felt like she was someone i knew. 

this will be added to my list of top vr experiences. the amazing hellblade 2 trailer really has my fingers crossed for a vr version of that too. primarily being a microsoft release for xbox, however, i'll try not to get my hopes up. i realize the odds are strongly against it. if the original devs are still involved and have any say in the matter, please know that what you did here is greatly appreciated and i'd love to be able to visit senua and this world in vr again.",1594591779,3,0,697118

"incredible, i generally wait a long while to write a review for a game, but this was just so much constant fun that i had to leave a review immediately. 

worth it at full price. if you are still doubtful, rounds last about 3 minutes at most so you can easily play a couple dozen rounds and decide if you want to refund or not.

i don't have other friends to play vr with so i can't talk about that specifically.

regarding weapon unlocks and progression:
- the weapons you get at the start are more than enough to win, i've personally beaten people at level 10+ with only the starting guns (you unlock 1 gun per level up to level 15, at 1 hour i've reached level 5). 
- but, it would be nice to be able to test guns you haven't unlocked, so you know what to expect. i went up against someone with a gun that could curve bullets and i was a bit surprised at first, if i knew that such a thing existed i wouldn't have been so surprised. 
- and it would be nice to choose which gun we unlock per level, to fit each user's preference.
- everything else is cosmetic and you get more than enough in-game currency to buy the guns as you unlock them from the store.



great for competitive players and there's no fun lost for casual players either. i found games quickly.


edit:
after player for a while longer some problems did show up:
*the first is that mid-game i would often get kicked out because there was a ""challenger approaching"" and it would put me against someone. this wasn't very annoying because i wouldn't lose rank (and it would match you to someone at a closer level), but it is jarring.
*the second is that i had 2 games in a row where the match just wouldn't start, the opponent and i would just have a dance battle or rock-paper-scissors until one of us forfeited, not good.
* no problems in these past 2 months, shame i moved somewhere where i can't play a vr game like this anymore (not enough space in my room), glad to be a translator for the game",1609713361,0,1,409891

"i've been playing thru this game and overall i'd say it's pretty fun. it advances like a play, each sequence is a short scene with a small game play area. 

things i didn't like:
the biggest thing i disliked and also the biggest challenge in game play is aiming.  most of the weapons have either a poor front sight post or nonexistent rear sight aperture, making target acquisition difficult and center mass impossible to find. even with a vr rifle, aiming mechanics just miss the mark. a big part of the problem seems to be the generally poor gaming resolution.

the story is fairly fun, but it seems a bit cartoony, like the target audience was 12 and under. i expect something more gritty and realistic.

the environments are not as interactive as i would expect from a vr experience.

the game play is a bit clunky

things i like:
cost, it is a vary reasonably priced game. it is short and feels truncated, but thats what you get with a stand alone vr platform and the price reflects that. 

there are lots of weapons and you are provided with plenty of ammo to run and gun.

the environments are simple but detailed and fairly immersive.

the sound good and immersive

loading the weapons is easy and fun.

the learning curve is small.

grenades are relatively easy to learn and use. though you cannot control the fuse burn by holding the grenade spoon. once the pin is pulled, the clock is ticking.",1670429100,5, ,289969

the voice work of your character is enjoyable enough and never got on my nerves. sometimes i even chuckled. the game itself has a few rough spots where it's obvious they rushed through building the enviroment and they didn't do everything they wanted to do with the time they had. there are medipacks and melee weapons around in such numbers that it seens obvious that they were to have a bigger place in the game.

[b]highlights:[/b][list]
[*]co-op mode absolutely shines! the game encourages specialization and teamwork.

[*]full range of motion is used to navigate environments. you will climb vines, swing across poles over gaping chasms, get on the ground and crawl through tight cave spaces. the world is wonderfully immersive and fun to interact with!

[*]one of the most responsive, kind, and interactive developers you will ever see. have suggestions? he wants em. hit a bug? he's on it. player input is wanted and acted on, and it shows. this is clearly a passion project. the game grows at an amazing pace for a single developer. these are the kinds of folks that are worth supporting![/list]

[b]closing thoughts[/b]
i was going to write a ""needs improvement"" section, but the truth is, for an early access product it's already more complete than many games with far larger budgets and development resources! the developer is highly responsive and completely engaged with this project, so things will only get better from here... and here, well, here is pretty solid already!

"i had a hard time deciding if this should be a positive or negative review. but hey.. it's free, and the tour of the german coal mine makes it worth spending some time on it.

the rest of the locations felt quite boring, imho.

the application itself has several huge problems.
navigation is difficult because the controllers will swich from active to inactive all the time depending on the place you are visiting. sometimes theres a button to click, but the controller laserpointer is simply not working.

some of the ""usability"" decisions are poor choices. in the coal mine the virtual guide will tell you to pick up an item to continue to the next area. but sometimes it's is rather difficult to teleport near the item, to be able to pick it up.
at other times you're so close to the virtual guide, that you keep turning the storytelling on and off, because just touching the guide will do exactly that.

on the glacier you have a compas that is somehow needed to move around. however, combined with the terrible controls mentioned above, i never really understood if i used to compas right, or what ever happend.

in death valley theres a map that is moved to change locations. how ever i am unable to choose other destinations on the map than the intended one, and then there is one of the maps where i can go where ever i want. the result is that i can't really be sure if i visited all areas or not. combined with the fact that selecting areas on those maps is so painfullly difficult to get work, i must admit that finally i didn't care if i'd seen it all or not.

the scenes vary a lot in quality, but generally all of them could have used a lot more work before release. they are captured 3d-images of some kind, which leaves several errors and artifacts in the scenes.

some scenes disable the controllers, which is signalled by having them vibrate. this is rather annoying because in some ares it can take minutes until they are useful again... the vibrating just keeeeps on going and going and going....

if the navigational problems could be fixed this app would be a sure yes, for recommendation. but anyway, it is sort of the same as destinations, which is now built into steam vr. so an easy fix would be to just port all the content to destinations.

"[b][i]walkabout boasts incredibly realistic physics, beautiful scenery, and a mature and friendly community. this is hands down one of my favourite, most played vr games (sorry beat saber, i still love you).[/i][/b]

[u]note:[/u] i purchased walkabout on steam just to write a review- because they definitely deserve it. i actually have closer to 30+ hours at the time of writing this review.

the graphics are stunning, and there is a large variation in map design which keeps things fresh. the controls are super receptive, and it feels like you're playing the real thing; this contributes to a very immersive experience. i have had issues with motion sickness in many other games, but only twice in walkabout- and in all fairness, that is because i was flying around like a mad woman. completely my fault!

as a bonus, i have had a lot of fun searching for the lost balls and following clues around the maps. though this isn't the main intention of the game, i have launched a few times and played on solo just to continue the treasure hunt. there is also fun character customisation, different coloured and patterened balls and various putt designs (if you find them!). and i mentioned you can fly, right?!

the developers are really engaging with their community and actively listen to ideas. they also frequently release new content, including in the form of paid map dlcs, which i feel are fairly priced. lots of respect for this amazing team of devs!

one of my favourite things about walkabout is the social aspect. from my experience, the walkabout community doesn't discriminate; there is a huge variation in skill and commitment. if you want to join a tournament and play more seriously? go for it. if you just want to pick up a casual game every now and again, you'll fit in equally as well. even if you can't hit the ball to save your life while the rest of your group are consistently getting par at worst, you will find it is a very encouraging and kind community (deeeeeefinitely speaking from experience here- oops). 

if you plan on playing walkabout socially, i definitely recommend joining their discord. there are constantly new games opening up and it's the easiest way to play with others. happy golfing!",1644133658,3,0,408225

it's stories like these that can show vr can be a great medium for story telling. it's art style is beautiful and the characters are lovable. i quickly forgot where i was and just fell into the story. wonderful work and worth checking out.,1542425014,5, ,341235
"it's early access so you have to remember, you are paying to play test the game and help make it better... otherwise you should wait for it to leave early access before buying. what it has is solid... i just hope they are still working on it. seems like a while and nothing really heard about updates. i found the mechanics to be easy to get used to but just enough of a challenge to keep from breaking things. takes finesse rather than brute force. if i had to gripe on something, it would be variety. it's just buying mods for a few fast food items and that's kinda it. if job simulator had a better competitive mode, the things you could do were really wrong... but they worked as gamification. so yeah, it needs more variety. it may need a hooters franchise tie in dlc to help boost sales and interest... i dunno. i like the game.",1608079865,2,0,729707
"really great and unique game! runs very well and is tons of fun to play with friends and provides lots of different game modes (i particularly like the ""horror"" mode). i highly recommend playing with both mandrillia. it's the best asymmetric vr game and the best to come out of the steam vr fest that i've played and and i'm looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future! highly recommend picking this one up!

the vr player controller is very nicely made and works as you'd generally expect. this is built to the modern vr game standard with proper grip controls, controller tracking, weapon handling, etc. lots of quality-of-life options are available to them including: snap-turn (toggle and angle), smooth-turn (toggle and speed), grip modes (hold and toggle), height calibration, head or controller relative movement, trackpad support, a lefty-mode and more. the vr player has access to a wide variety of tools and weapons (not necessarily from the start depending on the game mode). the atmosphere for the vr player is really good overall and it's very tense while not being overly scary once you get used to it. be aware: the only movement option is smooth locomotion. this is not a negative for the game as it's very necessary for the experience of the game, but i know that this is important for some people. the slow player movement speed may help to ease motion sickness so try it out for yourself.

steam remote play works well for the game if you've got the bandwidth to support it. this is a multiplayer-only (for now), sort of arena-style game. there is currently only one map to play on, but there's a wide variety of game mode options and fine control of many of the player stats (both for pc and flatscreen) so you can mix-up and balance the game really however you want. this is a really helpful feature as the game settings may require some tweaking to achieve a nice balance between the vr and flatscreen players based on the number of players and the skill of the vr user. the objective for the vr player is to find purple keycards that can be used to open doors rooms that provide better equipment and a yellow keycard. with 3 yellow keycards they can leave and win the game. the mandrillian's goal is simply to kill the vr player.

playing as the mandrillia is most fun when you can coordinate with another mandrillia player and when you tweak the in-game options to have a nice balance between the killing power of the vr player and the mandrillia. the mandrillia have a simpler set of actions they can perform compared to the vr player, but must use stategy, game knowledge, and suprise to succeed.

to german bandera (the dev): you've got a great game here, the core idea is solid and the execution is overall very good. besides the fundamentals of what the game is, what i like most is the atmosphere and how well the vr integration works; it's a tricky thing to get right and you've managed it very well! it's the best asymmetric vr game i've played so far!

in terms of complaints/feedback (besides the improvements you've already planned on): using the mandrillia is a bit confusing when you first start, figuring out how the attacking and the smelling mechanic worked took a while and i still don't know what the powerups are. as the vr player, the grabbing of items in the world is a little finicky (picking items in the inventory works flawlessly) and while i didn't personally need one, i think an optional comfort vignette for moving might allow more people with motion sickness to play the game. my complaints are really minor though and they don't really detract from the game too much, but they might reduce the friction of getting new people into the game.",1658599835,0,,119336163

"new edit:

ok, the developers are keen to help and seams to be taking it seriously. performance got better and some bugs are being ironed out. looks promising now. the game is fun. do you want to be a ninja in vr? this is something close.


how the f**k can someone implement so many bugs in a such simple game?
the train map is broken on 80%. either enemies shoot at you from outside of the level or the dloors don't open to the net room, despite having cleared the area.
yesterday they had crashes on level end, every time (100%). today they fixed it, but introduced a crash on steam-key press, also every-time.
after warps weapons aren't active for about one second, which is annoying like hell seeing your weapons do nothing to the enemies in direct vicincy.
performance is extreamelly bad with fickering frames and shudder for this mobile-game level of graphics.
the power-ups are completelly unbalanced and hard to find thanks to mediocre menu design.
weapons reloadiong by shaking the weapons is a pain in the arse. sometimes you flicker and shake the weapons for about 10 seconds and no reaload. especially the left weapon don't really care about reloading when the player wants it. a frustrating and annoying game, it's an even worse let-down because the principles and fighting sty?e is in basic very cool and satisfying.",1495815142,2,1,574949

"even considering the price tag of the hardware required, you can't ask for more from the expereince.  i just had the opportunity to take this to my family and let my nephews, age 4 and 6 play this, and they were in love with it.  the whole vr paid for itself, and this game was a big part of that.

there is plenty to do, it is broken up, generally, in two types of experiences.  interactive and actual games.  both ware wonderful, the ones that feel more like games are satisfying and present the vr very positively.  the experiences are very high quality, and leave me personally with no complaints that are not beyond petty.

this is all based on what seems the portal universe, and as a resul tthe humor when applied is everything you could ask, some parts tie in directly to portal.  it's funny and entertaining, and most people who have played my vive have been happy to go through them multiple times.

if you have a vive, you have no reason not to have tried this game first.  for anyone thinking of buying a vive, i think this game should be the first game you play, it will immediately exhibit the vast differences between the gear vr and a full vr set.",1480298197,3,0,465421
"all the people here who bought this video game to admire its surreal cubes have precisely the wrong mindset. i, in my exalted wisdom and unbridled ambition, bought this video game to become fully accustomed to the intensity of its cubes, to make its rapid cubes destroyable. i have become very familiar with its movements and patterns, so that all the world around me may fade into a fluffy arena of gravitational inconsequence. and it has worked, to profound success. i abolished many cubes. i have grown attached to the downward pull of my tired arms, their desire to be one with the floor. this force has become so normal to me that lifting any other object now feels like lifting cotton candy, or a fluffy pillow. big burly manly men who pump iron now seem to me as little children who play other video games such as vr chat or pavlov..

i can hardly remember the days before i became a man of cubes. how distant those days seem now, how burdened by the apparent heaviness of everyday objects. i laugh at the philistines who still operate in a world devoid of cube destruction, their shoulders thin and unempowered by the experience of obliterating cubes. ha, what fools, blissful in their ignorance, anesthetized by their lack of meaningful struggle, devoid of passion.

nietzsche once said that a man who has a why can bear almost any how. but a man who has mastered cube destruction can bear any object less powerful, and all this talk of why and how becomes unnecessary.

schopenhauer once said that every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world. cubes expand the limits of a man¡¯s field of vision by showing him an example of increased strength, in comparison to which the everyday objects to which he was formerly accustomed gain a light and airy quality. who can lament the tragedy of life, when surrounded by such lightweight objects? who can cry in a world of styrofoam and cushions?

have you yet understood? this is no ordinary video game. this video game has the potential to transform your world, by transforming your expectations. those who have not yet destroyed cubes will not understand, for they still live in a world of normal speed and strength, like plato¡¯s cave dwellers. those who have opened their mind to the cubes will shift their expectations of speed and strength accordingly.

to give this video game a rating of anything less than a thumbs up would be to condemn life itself. who am i, as a mere mortal, to judge the most fast and sweaty video game of our century? no. i say gratefully to whichever grand being may have created this video game: good job on the cubes. they sure are quick.

i sit here with my swollen arms and dislocated wrists, transcendent above death itself. for insofar as these cubes will last forever, i am in the presence of immortality.",1652990847,3,14,617114

"i really enjoyed this game so far, i bought it last night before bed and ended up playing for an hour and a half!

this game is very cute with its cartoony design, the planes are very cool starting with a ultralight and you work your way up by earning money with missions.

there is quite a bit of variety with this game, the ultralight comes with a pistol in some missions where you have to do fly by shootings on balloons as you navigate the map. 

it seems most of the planes have their own unique weapons the next one is like a wwii plane it comes with machine guns on the nose and there are dogfighting missions.

as you progress you have to buy new airports for new jobs or ops. the difference between jobs and ops are as follows (from my understanding) 

job: like a training mission shoot drones fly through hoops do a barrell roll

ops: like a warzone mission enemies will be shooting at you and you have to follow the mission criteria.

overall so far i feel this game is fun, engaging and also doesn't take itself serious. i love the splash screen when you die as well.

the game runs very well on my system, intel i5 10400f rtx 3060ti 16gb ram. playing on oculus quest 2

"6/10 - generally a good experience with some very frustrating controls and mechanics


the good
- interesting apocalyptic setting
- okay voice acting
- great art style
- good selection of weapons and upgrades
- good game length

the bad
- controls are a nightmare
- some very strange mechanic choices
- fairly poor performance
- confusing missions
- wonky stamina system

occasionally this game feels great, you'll be drawn into the world creeping through the dark corridors of an abandoned gymnasium with sweaty palms wonder whats around the next corner, you'll battle your way out and have a moment to take a breath, and then out of nowhere you will be spotted by a lone walker, you've just decapitated half a hoard and you can handle one more.... except your arm gets randomly extended and tangled and the thing is latching on to you.... aaaand you're dead.

the clunky control glitches lead to some extremely frustrating deaths and really take you out of the moment, charging an enemy human and swinging your samurai sword only to have it kinda, bluntly thud and then bend your arm a weird way while they shoot you is garbage.

it's not always clear what you're supposed to be doing, i got a mission to travel to rampart... but the map didn't work, so i traveled to an area closer to it, but it still didn't work, so i traveled back to the hub, it still didn't work, i went asleep, it didn't work, i slept again, got given a mission by another person, then it worked. kinda disrupted  the experience.

the performance was pretty bad for me, using an rtx 2060, intel core i7-9750h with 16gb ram, i had to run the game on low the entire time.

i was playing on a htc vive cosmos, iron sight aiming on 2 handed weapons is impossible, that is htc's fault more than it is skydance, but for future iterations please include shoulder stock, where the gun locks to your shoulder (as an option).

your hands feel like they're dead weights, the aiming is like you're underwater, you seem to be able to oversteer on your shots making gunfights really not satisfying.

so far i have only played three maps/towns and you are stationary each time as the towns folk attacks you from inside of the building and also running at you, as a wave shooter it's very engaging and nice to see at the end of each round they is a boss fight.

this one star is well deserved.",1543289014,5, ,314012
"update 11/2020:
developers have listened! they remediated the camera problem enough. the ai is much better. would be nice to be able to customize it, but the fact that i can add so many makes it easy to simply overrun the tree player if they keep winning. on some levels some of the bots still can¡¯t correctly navigate to the tree but usually at least a couple make it even on the most difficult levels.  you can now add as many bots as you want (to the max limit)! this is great because now if the tree player wins we just up the bot count by one until the tree loses. you can now pick the level you want to play. and their are a ton of levels. which makes up for the hit or miss ai - just pick levels without fall offs and water if the tree keeps winning.

lastly, i usually hate micro transactions and dlc. but offering skins to the squirrels on the phone is exactly the kind of transaction i approve of.


below is my original review, but the devs should be praised for fixing every con i listed:

with 3 or fewer players this game is sadly one sided. the tree always wins.

pros:
vr features (throwing things and moving in place) work really well.
different squirrel abilities (builder, digger, etc) gives the game a good helping of replay-ability.
the game is pretty fun.

cons:
squirrels can't see when returning to base - the camera angle is always pointed at the tree. the developer had said, repeatedly that this is intentional. but it means that on levels with water, or voids the squirrels fall in before they even see the drop. and if there is a ledge the squirrels just get stuck. if you're trying to nerf the squirrels by making them memorize the maps then i personally think the game just isn't well thought out.
ai is dumb. there are a couple of levels with water and drop offs and the ai simply never makes it back to the base with an acorn even if (as the tree) i throw nothing. sadly this means that you can't make up for lacking enough friends by adding cpu players.
requires a ton of friends and phones! i would increase my rating considerably if i could play online with strangers, or add an arbitrary amount of cpu players to my room. as it is i have 3 phones/tablets in my house and 1 headset. the best i can do is add 3 squirrels to my game, then after the game starts i have one of the tablets disconnect (because i don't actually have 3 friends to play with) - then a cpu takes over.
can not pick the levels. my 7 year old daughter (like the cpu ai) can not manage to cross voids/water without dying. would be nice if i could specify which level i want when she is playing a squirrel.

it's possible that, as squirrel players get more experience playing the game will self balance. however there needs to be a way to nerf the tree until then
i would say that if the developers somehow fix the game balance (allow more cpus, allow online matchmaking, or nerf the tree?), and fix the squirrel camera view this could easily be my favorite party game. and would warrant 5 stars",1605151414,5, ,177109
"this game definitely delivers on the hype. great game.

i also find that i have to be conscious of keeping both my paddle and the ball in view at all times so that the headset cameras can properly sync my hand speed with when and how i actually intend to return the ball. this does not always correct the problem, however.
again, this is a great game, but it does not replace a real table and real paddle experience - and i don't expect it to. worth the money though and a good time.",1614396214,5,"hi oberon.todd.9, please reach out to us so we can add you to the better tracked version that is coming up.

"+fun

+great show of what the knuckles controllers can do.
+nice way to support developer who released free version of (almost) same game

-skully commentary gets a little irritating at times

4/5

really great remaster of one of the very first vr experiences. now upgraded to fully utilize the valve knuckles, and adding in a few extra toys and areas to play with. although honestly didn't see all that much of a difference between this ""extended edition"" it was hardly extended. however, that's not a bad thing, as it's a great way to support a good developer and hopefully egg them onto making something different. if you're looking for a good game to show off what the knuckles can do, this is one of the ""first knuckle experiences"" i feel everyone should try.

"still no full left handed support.

asked for this back in january and was told it comes with may update, then it was pushed back to summer where we got the first half of that update, that is weapons being on your left hand. still the controls were with right handed bindings and no way to rebind yourself in steamvr controller settings or an option for those. so in june they said the are working on it. after that only silence.

me and other started asking again when this update will come out until we got a reply on november stating that this update is puhsed backe even further because they are working on the stand alone port oft that game. first this is a big middlefinger for all left handed players that bought the game here on steam an waited patiently second another example the devs running after meta and pico getting a mobile port out before finishing on the platform they started on.

i am so fed up with this. we waited so long to finally play it propperly as a left handed player and that's what we get as a thank you for your long support and buying that game. this negative review stays on won't be deleted by ""promising"" an update soon again and if i have another issue i can joins their discord. no...just no.

"first review i've written on here.

this title is amazing and exactly what i've been looking for in vr since before i got my first headset. 

the adventure and social experience, as well and the seamless rpg aspects will have me ignoring every other title in my quest 2 for a long time.

great job ramen vr team! super proud of you and i am excited to see how you continue to develop the game.

fyi:

virtually every negative review of this game is associated with the first few hours of server troubleshooting the first 4 to 6 hours after launch. i logged in about 6 hours after launch, created an account, and have had zero issues since then. it now runs flawlessly.

those who were complaining on launch day need to grow up and get a grip on the reality of launching an mmo, especially with such a small team. every mmo launch goes through the same issues. these guys got it figured out in a matter of hours.

this game is an absolute steal. if you're interested in mmorpgs, just get this game.",1643473560,5, ,283574

"i have played this game for as long as i've had free time today, so i'll only give a quick review of the most important points.

the game is well thought out in terms of mechanics. you can choose between teleporting or manual walking, which for some is fantastic news. the game offers a tutorial in the main menu, but there is no form of tutorial in the campaign, so be sure to play that first. 
within the first hour of gameplay, there was a really fantastic mechanic used that i am shocked other vr games haven't taken advantage of. i won't specify what that is for the sake of keeping it a surprise, but it happens near an elevator. 

i haven't really gotten to fighting yet, so i can't comment on that.

my two very personalized two cents: the demo was fantastic when it came out, and the boss fight was like nothing i had ever seen before in vr at the time. the full game so far feels very polished and professional, and for under 20$, i'm very comfortable in saying that you will feel like it was well spent. give it a vertigo!",1482429646,3,1,483224

"this game is tons of fun. my only issues are the following:

* campaign mode is very short. you can finish it within a day or two.

* campaign mode is very repetitive. general theme is: find a new area -> zombies show up -> kill the zombies -> repeat. there are occasionally some extra elements to the adventure like having to find a key or having to blow something up to clear a path, but these are made as simple and unimaginative as possible.

also, many pistols do have a stock attachment, you can... theroticly add a stock to your fifty call pistols... go with that as you well
also, add shot guns their own attachments, i don¡¯t think adding a suppressor for a pistol would work for a 12 gauge 

the story is... forgettable, but i don¡¯t think this is a negative, more just an annoyance, i don¡¯t care about this forgettable character does this thing, and i have no reason too because the enemy doesn¡¯t seem threatening, more just brainless children with fully auto rifles. allow us to see why the taloki are a threat, and why we are in gaged in a freaking war with em and give us a reason to why (minor spoilers) this person betrays us instead of it being ¡°ight here¡¯s a reason to leave now even tho the gas is... nonexistent¡±
the story doesn¡¯t ruin the game, but with most of the maps in coop just being story missions, i can see being annoying.
and if you decide to add new maps and missions, make the turrets useable, as your a bullet sponge while operating the gun, maybe add like, a perk to your arsenal to have like, a little shield on the gun, and a trade of being your one gun short.
 and, maybe even give the ai different types of weapons, i¡¯m so bored with seeing them with an ak, spas, or val. (yes i memorized every fire arm they have) so go insane give them ar15s they got from fallen soldiers, you can really establish how much of a threat the toliki are just by showing how ruthless they are.
another thing i wish they added is some kind of pvp, coop is fun, and can lead to some pretty fun gameplay, but replaying the same missions over and over get old.
maybe change up some existing maps, adding different routes for pvp, this will help the game greatly in my opinion

other wise it¡¯s an amazing game, and one of the only games on a normal quest that allows you to s t y l i s h l y   reload your akm, witch i know each one of you desperately wanna do in other vr shooters.

unfortunately i have to neg this game. it's too buggy. whenever i close it (close button on its window) or it crashes, when i open it again i'm back to the first zomb wave. it simply has no save. it hangs too many times (it stops tracking head movement and image freezes, for a few seconds), most of them it comes back, some of them it crashes with no message (its window closes itself), a few of them i'm killed by faster zombs before i can restock my guns and restart shooting.

this game should be on early access yet, in 2018. it's way too bugged and unstable to be considered a final product.

about the story, from what i can tell before the game crashes, it's the boring zomb game that doesn't bother explaining why everybody became zombs.
yet another zomb game. it has a bad tasted humor, protagonist talks to zombs asking them to behave and keep distance (the feeling that zomb games are becoming used). we have to follow a single path looting cars and places and killing waves of zombs. idk if it remains like that or if something changes later.

about graphs, its window is very small, it's a first generation vr game. in-vr it's very polished, textures are very good. zombs models are too few and repeat more than they should. and they are too childish for my taste.",1524693099,2,0,435901

"sacralith is not a bad game but i also wouldn¡¯t say it¡¯s a good game; which is why i can't recommend it. it¡¯s a fine time waster but the game play is not very compelling and i finished the campaign in just under 2 hours. while there is technically more to do i have no interest or desire to go back.

the entire game boils down to an escort quest where you, as the archer, are doing your best to escort the damage sponges on the ground. if that doesn't sound particularly fun¡­ it's because it's not. enemies don¡¯t interact with you in any way so the game boils down to a shooting gallery where you occasionally needing to go back and babysit your followers. enemies spawn in an endless parade of willful ignorance that, if you don¡¯t deal with fast enough, can keep your sponges locked in an endless circle jerk or worse; slowly drag them away from any of your teleport points until they're too far for you to even assist. 

when any one of them die you lose so, like every escort quest, their ai is important to keep you from wanting to murder them yourself and sacralith's ai doesn't do itself any favors. the animation isn¡¯t very good either; the little cutscene at the beginning of the campaign was a bit cringy, battle animations don¡¯t interact with each other very well and the dragon just¡­ eh.

the upgrade system is a neat part of the game but its hindered by the fact that it just bursts up in your face when you level making it extremely jarring. what each upgrade dose is not super clear and would have benefited from either showing the player with a small animation of its intended purpose or even letting the player 'warp' to some sort of side area or mind-space where they can play with it to decide what they think will work best for them. once bought, selecting the arrow type you want in the heat of battle isn¡¯t particularly easy either.  often times i would want one type of arrow for a particular problem that had cropped up but twisting back and forth, hovering over each type of arrow to look at their icons and trying to remember 'was it the scratched shield icon or the stabbing through the shield icon'.

there are a lot more things i wasn¡¯t fond of; the elephant sequence, the ending, the unusual difficulty of drawing arrows, the random crashes. game's worth a couple bucks but, honestly, i've found skyrim's *ported* vr archery more interesting =(",1580615971,3,0,690053

"really fun and addicting. just picked it up and started playing, next thing i knew i've been going at it for over an hour and i'm dripping in sweat lol. 

pros:
-addicting
-simple yet kept my interest for an hour straight (didn't even move past easy yet)
-scoreboard is nice (reason why i didn't go past easy yet is because i wanted the high score first!)
-controls are very simple
-small, almost meaningless feature...but i really like how you can dribble the ball and try for bounce shots or just volleyball spike it for fun!

cons:
-lack of music. sure i can play my own music, but a nice tune in the background would be nice! i think i could get even more into it if there was.
-i dislike how a hoop can come up right in front of another and block your shot. it almost punishes you for scoring too quickly
-the fire from the ball can block your vision a bit. would be nice to see it tuned down a bit (though i love how the ball lights on fire. reminds me of nba street lol)

"sairento is really fun to play. the movement system is the best part about the game by far and i hope others implement this waypoint/teleport hybrid system in other games. 

locomotion can be very disorienting and i have been inconsistently getting sick. sometimes im sick in 15 mins and sometimes i don¡¯t get sick for over an hour of playing. so, take the game in small increments and frequent breaks until your brain gets used to it. 

the downside is that the graphics really have taken a hit. although the weapon textures are amazing, the textures for enemies are pretty bad. i like the way a couple enemies look, the geisha and blue samurai look pretty good, but others look almost like n64 models. a couple levels are graphically more impressive than the others as well so this leads me to believe that it could be better overall with some optimization. 

content is very deep. the relic bonuses are useful for stats and some added skills feel like you are progressing, but you start with every weapon there will be in the game. i would have preferred to have limited basic weapons while unlocking some more as the game progressed as part of the loot system. for example, the starting swords this way have no benefit over the others as some do more damage straight away. 

overall the game is very fun and though the quest chip is rather limiting for graphics, i do believe that models and textures could be improved either by restylizing some enemies or rounding polygons out a bit more.

for the price this game is really incredible. if they add more content like they plan to, hopefully with weapons(or skins), maps, and enemies, the game will be infinitely replay-able. at the moment, however, you still at least get your moneys worth and can build up your vr legs while having a lot of fun.",1561778614,5,"Thanks for giving us a nice review and we are glad you felt that you got your money's worth!

it has some spooky moments that make you jump and panic, but most of it's strength is in the atmosphere, which can be quite tense and heartpounding at times. lighting is just dark enough to induce uncertainty and the sound design makes you look over your shoulder ;)",1673208938,0,,130457594

"tl:dr - this game is so much fun like oh my god. aside from half life: alyx this is probably the most immersive vr game i've ever played; it's for sure my favorite, no contest! the atmosphere of this game is unparalleled mainly because it's a vr game but even without that it would still feel incredible. never has a game filled me with such a primal fear for my life like into the radius. 

i wanna give a few actual examples from when i played this game. this one just happened to me about 30 minutes ago, i was sneaking my way into this little village when i found a collapsed building with a hole in the floor that had a crate in it which i could loot, obviously i drop down to go get it cuz why not. as i drop down, walk over and squad at the crate i hear the voice of a child start singing a nursery rhyme and footsteps walking past the building above me. i whipped out my shotgun swung around and pointed towards a window where the sound was a just stood there for like a minute waiting to see something. but nothing ever came. 

another time back in the 1.0 version of the game i had made it pretty far into the zone (this was back before they updated the map and it was just one big area instead of multiple) and i had found a pump action shotgun in some hangar and was fucking stoked. obviously i did what anyone would do and racked it and realized this is like the only vr game i've ever played where you can rack the shotgun repeatedly without having to fire off a round. so i'm just racking this thing over and over loving the sound it makes and as i'm doing this i'm bobbing up and down in sync with it. as i bob down i hear a gunshot, and a bullet whiz directly where my head was half a second ago. i nearly shit myself and pretty much threw the shotgun across the room as i spun around and pulled out my rifle.

last one i'm gonna share i was trudging back to base and i had mistimed how long my mission would take and it was pitch black, could not see a damn thing and didn't have a flashlight. all the sudden i hear the sound of a spawn (tentacle spider thing that runs and jumps at you, suckers are small and damn hard to pin down until after they jump) rushing me in the dark, i pull out my pistol and by sound alone in pitch black darkness i manage to dodge the things jump and shoot it. 

as you can probably tell the sound design in this game is excellent and it's only gotten better with their recent update i will say the new shotgun sound is stupidly loud, like blow your drums out loud but honesty it fits so i don't mind. every enemy has a unique sound profile that will let you identify them. (save fragments, and phantoms but their basically the same thing cept fragments are more common and slightly tougher cuz of their gimmick.) the anomalies also have unique sounds for each to help you identify when you're near one that you can't see, along with great visual affects for the ones you can.

my only complaint so far is using two handed weapons (at least left handed) can feel kinda wonky unless you're aiming the gun at something. other wise it can feel kinda stiff and sometimes makes a sound like it's hitting something when it isn't. the game used to have a problem (in my opinion) with the economy, i think they wanted to make a game where guns ammo and other resources were scarce to enhance the feeling of survival and risk when you fought enemies but honestly it was so annoying trying to buy a new gun, you'd buy a rifle or a shotgun but then the ammo would cost so much you would rarely even use them because you would spend like all of your money from missions on it and have nothing left. luckily recently it feels like they've certainly fixed that, i currently just bought an sks and ammo for it and my sidearm with money to spare, plus the ammo i have will actually last me a good long while. granted i am playing with increased sell prices but most of my money has come from missions so i don't think that's why.",1651954010,0,0,362793

cons
- extremely predictable plot and odd pacing
- few animations; aside from in-place motions, characters usually move by materializing and dematerializing
- everything aside from the characters suffers from very low detail
- vr scale is incorrect... everything is huge
- a short endgame sequence that was basically google translated

only things other than that now is the inability to shuffle playlists, and the fact that music isnt shared amongst the party, really would make all the differences both those additions were made. 

look forward to the new lanes as that will def help to add some needed variety, and hope more will come in the future. i can see this one being one we will revisit for a long time, just classic competitive fun that doesnt really lose its appeal. i mean we still play high velocity bowling on ps3 from about 15 years ago time to time, cant say that about many other games. 

highly recommend!

¡ª¡ª months later, game is still great but the youtube/media player access needs to allow shuffle on playlists and party should be able to hear same soundtrack! it seems like a small detail but would add so much! just better for the individual in solo play to have shuffle to avoid the repetition/constant dj¡¯ing we are stuck with now, and in a party w friends, just all enjoying and talking about the same music as it plays is just so needed. hope its possible and coming!

"after falling in love with a different matrix-inspired bullet-time vr game about being a total badass (namely, sairento vr)... i was surprised to discover that i really don't like superhot vr. 

the lack of artificial locomotion feels arbitrarily limiting, but the bigger problem is that mistakes are pretty easy to make and are heavily and terribly punished. i went back to the beginning of a sequence something like 10 times at one point and of course there's barely any variety when you go back (enemies and weapons and obstacles all spawn the same way and the enemies behave pretty much identically every time)... which felt ridiculously redundant. [b]i wouldn't mind the lack of variety and the goal of optimizing your path through a deterministic scenario, if i didn't have to redo five parts i already optimized just to get back to the 6th part i keep making some small mistake on.[/b]

the level design almost felt like a mobile game, with tiny puzzles that can be solved in seconds each, and i almost expected an advertisement to come up each time i had to grab the black pyramid thing to go to the next half-second puzzle. it didn't feel like a premium pc game.

the other problem i had was just a straight-up bug. [b]mind-blowing control doesn't work consistently on the valve index controllers.[/b]
so i was stuck at one part of the first sequence with mind-blowing for like 20 minutes, thinking i was doing something wrong, when suddenly after going back to what i tried the first couple times it worked for some reason.

also one of the things i wished sairento had was a real-time replay function, which i heard flat-screen superhot had and that sounded really cool, but [b]real-time replay is not there in superhot vr[/b] which was extremely disappointing. the whole thing might be redeemable if i could watch replays. because the more frustrated i played, the more hilarious i bet the replays would look. one part i had to redo repeatedly had an extra hammer and at one point instead of grabbing the pyramid i used the hammer to beat the already dead red dudes to tiny little pieces, before smashing the pyramid with the hammer and going to the next area. it was a single moment of catharsis.

random thing though: the crt screens look impressively realistic in vr. i spent a good couple minutes in that meta-vr room up close to each crt monitor, just staring.

if they added a replay mode and/or punished mistakes less severely, i could recommend this, but as it is it's an interesting concept with loads of potential for fun that just ruins all the fun with weak design and heavy punishments. for the player that enjoys games with severe punishment for small mistakes, this game would probably be an above average vr game in the realm of bullet-time action. but i think the greatest thing about videogames is the ability to experiment and make mistakes and have fun while doing so, and so this game is just not for me.",1562397352,3,0,614193
"i bought this game a while ago when i first got the quest, and i¡¯m still amazed by the new updates !! also i love the way the developers respond to these reviews! especially the lower rated ones lol. some people just can¡¯t admit they suck at a game and want a refund lol",1644438300,5,"Hey bryson.kaeo!  Thanks for the kind word and the review!  We've got some fun updates planned and honestly it's those 5 star reviews that makes them happen!

We realize that our game isn't for everybody - We honestly prefer people feel like they've gotten much more than they paid for, hence all the free updates.  
Truth be told, we feel that none of the games on the Quest store are 1-star games, because the process of getting on the storefront is a very involved one filled with many checks on quality and functionality.  Sure there are lots of games that don't appeal to us, but that's because they don't appeal to our tastes, not because they are 'bad'.

"really fun sandbox style game.  seriously brutal physics/gore which will make you laugh.  
a few points:
- sometimes my guns/ammo loses where it should be on my 'body'.  meaning i go to grab ammo at my physical waist but in the game i'm somewhere completely different.  
- i get stuck a lot on dead bodies, which is relatively realistic but very annoying that the player doesn't instinctively 'step over' the body.
- you can't really throw weapons (melee) to do damage.  melee itself needs to take a small page out of blades and sorcery for the right feel.  it is close though. 

but the biggest thing for me that is missing is a straight up 'level' type gameplay.  no real plot needed, but just thinking how fun this would be to go through an organized mission where you can replay in different manners (stealth, melee only, etc). 

super fun game though, highly recommend.",1665146456,0,,123482561
"i usually do not write serious reviews, but i saw brandon tweeting about reading criticism so i'd thought i'd throw in my two cents

spoiler warnings for below

when this game released, i was going crazy with anticipation. i didn't care it was a larger price than boneworks. they spent a lot of time making this game, updating their engine, and adding mod support, so i didn't mind the extra 10 bucks.
the atmosphere of being in fantasy land was amazing at first, though you are quickly thrown back into a more familiar mythos setting pretty quickly. 
my dumbass didn't know you had to pull apart the collectibles, and i was confused on why i could see the blue line appearing in the inventory, but have it to only drop. i thought it was bugged and left them. i had to replay the first chapter to go back and find the collectables i left.

like most people, i went into this expecting a campaign as rich as boneworks. i see people getting pissed that they have to do a couple gamemodes to unlock the rest of the story with the crane game, but i didnt mind. i think slz has the right to show off all the extra content of the game.

on chapter 4 i found out about a glitch pertaining to people with wmr headsets. the default bind to exit vehicles is right-thumbstick press. if you dont know how wmr headsets work, steamvr disables your thumbstick press button, binding it to open the steamvr menu. the buttons stay disabled even if you unbind the menu button too. 
so i found myself stuck on the little ride outside the building, unable to get out, and unable to change my controls to get out for some reason. (this was fixed with an openxr update, and now the game opens without steamvr, but changing back to the steamvr runtime, new bindings now work)

passing a couple more chapters, and i find what i think is a major flaw in the campaign.
the 5 odd chapters that have you play levels from sandbox and such.
after the first 2 i was actually starting to get annoyed. being honest, its my fault for missing the map at the beginning of the moon level, but i was going crazy hearing that song. (im sorry michael, i love you)
when it came time to do monogon raceway, i was scared about getting motion sick in the go-kart and not being able to get out of the kart to finish the level, but i tried anyway. finishing the level, im not able to reach the capsule to continue, so now i have to retry.
getting motion sickness is a skill issue, and thankfully im used to it now, and thank god slz thought of people like me, cause you can complete the race on foot, a poster inside tells you that. so now i have to redo the entire level, walking the whole thing for 10+ minutes, all going crazy to the soundtrack again (again sorry michael, you are really talented and i think you made one of the best soundtracks of all time)

by time chapter 11 hits, im sick and tired of these stupid gimmick chapters, i finish the chapter with no issue and stop playing for the day.
coming back to the game the next day, i am excited to play the rest of this game with the new avatar switching mechanics. seeing it in the trailer made me more than excited to see what kind of innovation slz will do with puzzles and such with all the provided avatars.
...
i finish chapter 12... avatar switching can be used in some situations to entice creative gameplay, but other than that, you can get by with only needing to use it maybe a handful of times.
okay, that was only one chapter, right? lets see what else slz has for me
...
chapter 13 is the final chapter, and there is no situation to use this new mechanic...
and thats my biggest gripe with what the game. under utilizing this new innovative mechanic for the game's campaign. it feels like it was added as an afterthought after developing most of the game, only dedicating one chapter to it.

okay so ive beaten the campaign and was severely underwhelmed, what about post-game content?
just like boneworks, we have many other gamemodes to do. ill get to those later.
we also have collectables that are cleverly hidden throughout the game.

i was annoyed not knowing how to open the capsules at first, i wish it was a little more clear because the two arrows you see was not enough for my stupid brain to compehend.
its 100% better than what we had in boneworks, but the lack of a checklist is very annoying.
boneworks had a little counter for each specific item in the main menu, but i didnt even bother finding them all and i downloaded an 100% save.
bonelab has a counter on the main menu, but doesnt break it down in any way at all. i dont even know if that counter is accurate, because other counters are bugged for me, like ive done everything in tac trials, but my bar of completion for it is still at like 30%.
i wish we were able to break down items to specific chapters. theres a lot of well hidden items, so a checklist for each chapter/location is needed here.
we have one for ammo! so i don't see why we cant have one for capsules.

other than collectibles, we have other gamemodes like parkour, sandbox, and tac trials. 
i feel parkour was kind of lacking, tho i imagine slz will be adding new content to these mods, and hopefully we see more mods and such for these gamemodes too.
its always a nice addition to see stuff like this, but being a big boneworks fan, im pretty much here for the campaign.
i loved the museum basement sandbox level a lot. it was fun seeing all the boneworks references in it. i hope we see more chapter-like levels like that.

well, this whole time i've been comparing this game to boneworks. but looking at the game by itself, i think it isnt fair to do that. 
yes, i am angry the campaign wasnt fleshed out like boneworks, but  i don't think that was slz's goal here.

i've heard people who have never played vr call boneworks ""the gmod of vr."" though that is very innacurate.
boneworks is the half-life of vr 
and bonelab is the gmod of vr.
(i know hl alyx is the half life of vr, but boneworks is better than that game dont @ me)

the reason why this game is feeling kind of lackluster right now is that slz is trying to make the garrys mod of vr.
since the game just came out and we are slowly getting more and more mod support for things, its lackluster right now.
imagine playing gmod with no mods.
yes, you can have fun with what the game has itself, but the game really shines with all the mods you can have fun with.

im really hoping the mod community ramps up with this game with a public sdk and such, im already seeing a lot more mods than what boneworks has gotten since release. and the game has only been out for like a week!

so yes, im really disappointed i didnt get what i expected, a true sequel to boneworks, and i hope to see this mitigated with extra content from slz, and modders
im trying to look at what this game is and what is has to offer, and im hoping its gonna be great.

to give a tl:dr with my major gripes, points i talked about, and how some issues i had can possibly be solved:
- i expected boneworks 2, not bonelab as it's own game
- i believe this game is more like a garry's mod, instead of a half-life game

- this game could use more content with traditional chapters, or other chapter-like things such as the sandbox map, museum basement
- new content should utilize avatar switching, having more puzzles and such give the player freedom to express themselves with what avatars types they want to use for certain cituations

- pls think about us wmr players for your next game on launch
- give us a checklist for collectables! tell us how many are in each chapter/map like how you have the ammo counter in the info menu!
- add man boob physics
- michael wyckoff, you are fucking talented and i love you.

thank you.

ill refrain from suggesting typical qol or content, because im certain there is more planned. so far bugs ive encountered include falling off maps after collision issues with objects, and tilesets that wont open because they think there are enemies, but i dont see any, though the music still plays, so maybe the enemy glitched elsewhere?

aside from the usual roguelite/like systems, id really like to see an npc companion, probably a tiny robo you hack to be an ally. would help spot enemies you miss, and it wont be so lonely going up the tower :)

                     shows as available then after installing it says it is no longer available. my daughter is extremely disappointed                  ",1583290800,1,,4423
"pros:
-	fantastic atmosphere
-	creative puzzles
-	easy movement

cons:
-	boring, messy story
-	incredibly overpriced / very short
-	confused puzzle design near the end
-	unclear what is and is not interactable

tl;dr
the room vr took me just under 3 hours (a third of which was spent wandering aimlessly) and my mother (age 50+) around 4.5.
the story consists of a short tutorial that sets the tone, then three escape rooms, capped off by a short yet paradoxically drawn out ending to the story not a single player cared about.

the puzzles themselves vary between fantastically brilliant to hair-pulingly tedious. thankfully, there are hints available with no punishment attached to them allowing the player to save on battery life and simply move on with their lives to the next puzzle which, fingers crossed, contains puzzle elements.

-	-

the real tragedy of the game is the puzzle design. of course, everyone¡¯s brain works differently and how you approach a problem, and even what clues you go into the problem with will all factor into the puzzles difficulty¡­
with that said, you will spend a significant portion of your play time wondering ¡®what¡¯ you are supposed to be doing and not ¡®how¡¯ you are supposed to be doing it.

for example, here are examples of some late game ¡®puzzles¡¯ (mild spoilers):
-	you are given a card and asked to retrieve something from the past. the card has a confusing symbol on the back that seems like it might be relevant to a previous puzzle only for the later revelation to be ¡®the card is a key to a slot you didn¡¯t know was a slot¡¯ and the symbol is meaningless.
-	there are three icons you need to find, and three plaques. two plaques have cryptic clues leading to one icon each, while the third has an identical format. after you spend an tragic amount of time trying to decipher the third plaque (or brute force the answer) you later discover there is a hidden fourth plaque; the third from before being useless.
-	an item you pick up is its own self-contained puzzle; as far as i can remember, this is the single instance of this happening in the entire game¡­ there is nothing about this this item that sets it apart from the others.

the game does some what help to clear things up by ¡®removing¡¯ useless items from your inventory and stopping you from revisiting locations that no longer have a use¡­
except quite often when it doesn¡¯t, allowing you to spend minutes flopping useless items around useless areas until you finally stumble over the cupboard you thought was just scenery.

all in all i can¡¯t say i didn¡¯t enjoy myself. for all the times i spent pacing my living room sighing, i spent two fold that tinkering with ancient and cursed artifacts and having an absolute blast. however, for about $10 an hour, i was expecting a little more.

"this is a fun game. there are, of course, improvements to be made. the ai could be smoother (the zombie will be three feet away, swing at me, and still hit). the shaking detection in the hands is a bit sensitive, which can make scoped weapons a pain. 
on the more specific side: the second level glitches for me when i go to rescue the last survivor. the giant armored zombie just stands behind a trailer and can't be killed. the survivors of that level could use some more health, as well. can be annoying when trying to shoot the zombies and accidentally shooting and insta-killing them instead.
on the third level the slingshot doesn't work (as far as i could tell). also, i do not think the mom should be able to detect you wherever you go if you get spotted.
overall, i think this is a great game with a lot of potential and that definitely deserves a play through.",1564217224,3,0,683377

i had two crashes where the game just froze (that's in one 45 minute play session).  the graphics are very variable, some awesome but mostly very bland.

the positives:

> facing off against an opponent feels as close to the real thing as you can get
> the game mechanics such as picking up and moving the pieces are solid
> great environments, feels very polished
> has the choice of animated fantasy pieces you can play with too! they have great attention to detail and feature individual static, fighting and death animations.
> computer ai is plenty challenging
> options to play friendly or ranked matches, and keeps track of your score, wins/losses

needs work:

> only two environments and chess sets to choose from for now (but more to be added in the future)
> would be great if there were unlockables e.g. new board types, pieces, environments etc. to unlock
> need to update the fb avatars

overall, they've done  great job with capturing the spirit of chess and i think if you like chess, are looking to get into it or even just curious, you can't go wrong for the price.

-gameplay is very enjoyable and unique.
-challenging but not too hard.
-slowing down time via how you move is the coolest thing in vr yet.
-great graphics and overall design.

cons
-there is currently no way to pause the game if you need to take off the headset, simply taking it off and putting it back on will cause time to move which can be deadly if you're not wearing the headset.
-game isn't very long.
-some bugs, mostly minor ones.

"this is a pretty fun game, have played it for a few hours and plan to play it more.  that being said, it's still early access / could use some areas of improvement.

1. i was playing with a valve index using ""grab"" mode.  one issue i ran into was a place to store a shield when climbing ladders.  my current tactic is throw it down the ladder if going down, or put it in inventory if going up.  it would be great to be able to attach a shield to a belt or back.  or maybe this functionality exists and i'm missing it?  note: can store weapons on belt with no problem

2. enemy distancing.  (update: not an issue now that i'm used to it) don't know if this is just a thing with early level skeletons or if i'm messing up, but i have done a little martial arts/hema before.  maybe i'm closing the distance too much and the ai continues to close while i close? not sure. the enemies always end up waaaay to close to me. like i can punch them, so why would i use a sword?  i'm now using a falcion underhanded so the blade is aligned with my forearm and am acting like my forearm is a giant blade.  note: maybe this is intentional so people with daggers can close more easily?  

3. the tutorial - it seems to require more patience than most people are used to nowadays.  may lose some players here

"this may be my new favorite vr experience. after trying the demo i was hooked by the way it felt to basically do super-human vr parkour. i would highly recommend trying the demo, especially since it is free and you have nothing to lose. even though it is limited it does a great job showcasing the potential with the game. however, i wasn't prepared for the feeling i would have going through the various levels in the full game.  

the game's movement mechanics really lend themselves to vr and is what sets this game apart from anything else on the vive. it's easy to get completely immersed once you start pumping your arms like a sprinter and start swinging around and flying through the air like some sort of crossfit spiderman. the amount of freedom you have when completing the level is what i really love about the game and it utilizes room scale nicely. there are so many ways to tackle the various obstacles and challenges that are placed before you. also since there is a more natural mapping to how your actions translate to movement in the game i didn't experience any type of motion sickness whatsoever and felt empowered beyond imagination. however, if you do get motion sickness there are options to help minimize this.

there were two moments i experienced that really blew me away and solidified this game as one of my favorites. the first is when instead of trying to climb across a beam to cross a gap i decided to just jump as high and far as i could. after swinging my arms downward as hard as i could i basically did a hulk jump and somehow landed directly on the goal after flying through the air for a few seconds. the second was when i had to reach a goal that was below me that i had to reach while flying through the air at high speed. based on my trajectory it looked like i was going to barely miss it so i dove on the ground backwards at the last second and was able to barely grab the goal.

the fact that this game will have online play and a level editor which allows for community created content makes me fully anticipate that the replay value for this game will be off the charts. i can't wait to see what this game becomes because right now it is looking like it may be the start of something epic!",1477481187,3,0,514640

it is a [i]very[/i] small experience, with only one interaction (two if you count pulling to trigger to board the triceratops), and runs about 3 minutes.  i had to run it through twice just to get enough time to post a review.

graphically, it's ok.  kudos to the creator of the asset pack purchased to create this, i doubt simsreality had the chops to make these originally.  there is clipping, the triceratops is pathed to walk directly [i]through a tree[/i] at one point, and for some reason the trees in the background are tracked to your headset, so they are constantly bopping around like a forest from a 1920s cartoon.  floating vegetation? check.

nothing much happens.  you lumber around a loop on a triceratops' back, spawn some roast chickens in a feeding box (which makes a weird cartoon *boing* for some reason), a t-rex wanders in, eats the chicken, then lets out a muffled, scratchy roar that i swear was ripped straight from a tv playing jurassic park and using a cheap microphone.  he wanders off and you circle back to the starting point.

free?  sure, but it costs you hard drive space that could go to a better experience, and it's not worth keeping around to demo for friends and newcomers.  try it and delete it, or just watch the store video; it has all the highlights anyway.",1570369940,2,2,367344

"first off, to get a more modern smooth locomotion control scheme, look for these settings:
under game options:
- locomotion type: stickmove
- comfort turns: on (the angle is under the blink options submenu, but i found the default 22.5 to be a good setting.)
in the stickmove options submenu:
- axis mapping: fwdbackstrafe
- movement anchor: controller
- (i also preferred the highest movement speed.)

for controllers with separate grip and trigger controls, there is an option for using grip to pick up objects.

after playing, i noticed there are sections of the forums dedicated to getting the game to run on oculus headsets, but i had no problems starting it on my rift cv1 through steamvr.

the gallery episodes 1 and 2 are often discounted pretty deeply (i think i paid $8 for the pair), to the point where the question isn't if they're worth your money, but if they're worth your time.
in short, i think they are, and that's largely down to episode 2, even with the knowledge that episode 3 may or may not ever be released.
episode 1 was released in 2016, and episode 2 followed in 2017.   one of the biggest improvements was the addition of smooth locomotion control options, which i sorely missed in ep 1.
each game could be described as a ""story-driven walking simulator with occasional puzzle elements"", with most puzzles taking the form of mini-game style challenges, especially in ep 2.
ep 1 was mostly linear, and takes around 1.5 - 2hrs to complete.  ep 2 manages to wring about 3-4 hrs of play from a similar number of environments because each area will need to be revisited at least once or twice  - sometimes to use an item found elsewhere, and sometimes to explore previously-inaccessible parts of the level.
that said, while there is a similar ""volume"" of world to explore in ep 2, the areas are much more detailed and interesting than those in ep 1 so i didn't find the backtracking particularly onerous.  there were frequent loading screens, but they didn't last more than a few seconds each with the game installed on an ssd.
while the dialogue can be a bit campy at times and story a bit vague, the performances are well delivered.
if you can pick up ep 1 and ep 2 together for under $10-15, i think they're worth it.  
(personally, i think they'd do well to give away ep 1 for free, and sell ep 2 for $10-12.)

the artstyle is breathtaking and the movement is also very good, so i hope the devs will continue on their paths to make all our lives better in this dark time!",1609959297,3,0,410290
"      the game is good, there's no doubt about it. the devs though are awful. they mapped the 11 songs, built a rectangle platform, and set the rules of:
1) hit the blocks in the right dirrection, or you're fucked.
2) avoid red walls and bombs, or you're fucked.
the rest of the game is comepletely made by the modding community. 
      i was playing a relatively quite song, and i thought to myself: ""hmmm, this song is sorta quite, lemme adjust the sound real quick"". there are no sound setting at all, there are only graphics settings. so i think it would be better for beat games to focus more on focusing bigger issues, such as:
1) lack of sound settings and other settings alike.
2) fixing bugs that don't register your sword slice.",1544938065,2,0,645000

there are some choicemaking in the story but the game is mainly about exploration, looting and fighting both the dead and the living.

                     beatmapping is awful. you should look to an elementary game like audiosurf and learn how to do it properly. there's no method to calibrate center-of-playspace and it's entirely off the room. walls do not appropriately gauge leans and ducks. i shouldn't have to leap outside my playspace boundaries (room-scale by the way) or lay on the floor to get through these obstacles. a good concept but a lot of work needs to be done before you should charge for this thing.

"i simply love this game; i've played the entire series and even bought the quest 3 just for this game?athough, of course, for other games as well. but when i heard that metro awakening would launch in vr, two hours later, i was unboxing my quest 3.

the soundtrack? outstanding, just as the developers have accustomed us to with their previous games. hearing that guitar accompanied by a soviet voice in a game again gave me immense nostalgia.

graphics? decent. i can't complain since i played on medium settings and recorded in obs at 30k, 1080p, 60 fps without any performance issues, frame drops, or anything like that.

gameplay? i?¡¥ve played for an hour and a half so far. it's decent, typical vr experience?atouching everything in sight, smashing every bottle of alcohol, either on someone?¡¥s head or on the ground. i was ""surprised""?ato say i almost had the scare of my life?awhen a massive monster jumped at me; in vr, it?¡¥s terrifying. when i got my first magazine for the gun, i was told to try shooting, and i aimed at its head. sadly, you can't test it on him, but oh well.

difficulty? i died on the first monster on normal difficulty, so i switched to easy right after :)))

from what i've seen in reviews, some people are complaining about performance issues, crashes, and so on. i haven?¡¥t experienced anything like that; i think it?¡¥s less about luck and more about each person?¡¥s setup, so don?¡¥t blame the game. a friend interrupted my gaming session because he couldn?¡¥t get past the main menu due to crashes, and he has other issues with various games (probably because he tweaked his nvidia control panel settings). i told him to reset to default, and abracadabra, it worked.

my setup is a razer blade with a 3070 ti, 12800h, 32gb ddr5, and a samsung m.2 ssd.

what can i say? get it; it?¡¥s worth it, especially if you?¡¥ve played their series in the past.

if you'd like, you can soon watch the game on my channel; the link is in my profile description.

until then, all the best, and have fun!",1730835286,0,,178461752

"i've played this game everyday for a year and i get up to play today and all of the sudden the new update has taking away the option to challenge anyone you want in ranked mode and now you have to wait forever for the computer to set a match up for you. its ruined the game ian switching to racket fury way to many bad updates on eleven! idk who is making these decisions but they have ruined a good game! 
so now you can't play anyone you want you play of the computer picks for you so if i'm a 2500 in rank and want to play someone higher than me i can't do that unless computer pairs me with them so i'm forced to at a 2100 that could take 25 pts from me but i only win 3 from them! on top of the fact that before i would have a match within 20-30 seconds after my last match ended, now it could be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-5 mins! i waited 4 mins this morning and just quit trying! but if you just wanna play for practice then it's a good update! if you enjoyed playing ranked! like me it's a bad update great game! just a bad update! but that's just my humble opinion i don't need a reply from developers 8f other people feel the same you will change it if not keep it maybe people like unranked better maybe i'm in the minority time will tell;
ps: all you have to do is make two lobbies.one for ranked and one for unranked! then everyone can still choose there own match without waiting on the computer but you would also give everyone the ability to play ranked or unranked and also choose they're matches! 
understood i will check settings and try to adjust, and your never gonna please everyone and people are/do get frustrated when people wanna play unranked. i have done it myself! so i can understand a need to fix or implement something different. so why not make two lobbies one ranked one unranked! wich you basically have now except instead of a computer going through algorithm , you enter wich lobbies you want so there is no invite confusion! then you can challenge other players who you already know want to play ranked/unranked based off wich lobbies you enter!  then  nothing to be ugly about! then you get the best of both worlds! a- the option to challenge whoever you want regardless of parameters wich was one of the best features in my opinion.
b- you can also challenge people who wanna play unranked like yourself wich you have now! so basically do it the same on the ranked as you have the unranked lobby! but leave the choice of who we play to us because it's quicker and allows us to play who we want and as quick as we want. no algorithms! please! or whatever it is that the computer is taking forever to search through put it back into the players hands who they play! you wanna play unranked go to unranked lobby! i wanna play ranked i go to unranked lobby and can challenge a 1500 or 2800 and play right then no waiting for computer to find me a match takes way to long thanks for listening only reason i'm spending this much time on reply is because i love your game! just frustrated with update but i get it! 
10 4 but you yourself said that based off my points most the matches i play i'm expected to win i don't pick on anybody i play every morning from 6 to 7 not a ton of people on at that time of the morning who are ranked higher than i am so that is why my expected win rate is 84%! alot if the matches you are referring to iam the one being challenged! do i except the match yes! because i wanna play as many matches as i can so your reply was completely rude and misleading! unprofessional! 
you can't see it it's a blank screen but i'll accept your apology it happens to the best of us kiddo!
and another thing don't try to make it sound like i said all games i played against a lower opponent were chosen i said alot your update was bad it's not my game my opinion make it however you want but if you post a link that can't be linked to that's the actual definition of misleading!!! i don't want to argue with you about it anymore either just make sure the link can be logged into so you aren't misleading these peopleoh i won't play again and you can keep your money you need it worse freind i play who is available at 6 in am i'm not ashamed of playing someone lower ranked than me! i'm very skilled at table tennis most people are gonna be lower ranked than me at 6 in am but keep on making excuses for a bad update you! be professional and take your medicine instead unprofessional and childish by running your mouth! and the reason i cant log into it is because it doesn't exist scumbag",1669796160,5,"Update 12:09

Update:
Hello. We are considering such an option, but it isn't as simple as you may imagine. I have some options I'll be happy to discuss with you to get your opinion. The simple explanation is that if there was a separate way to get ranked matches, fewer people would join the quickmatch pool, and the quickmatch system would start failing from a negative feedback loop. 

PS, I have looked up your match history, and the match history of some other very upset users, and I see the same pattern: that you and the other like to consistently play matches where your expectation of victory is significant. That is, your average opponent rating when you had a choice is -284 below you, while the rating when the system is automatching you is -24. At -284, you are expected to win 84% of the time. I understand why you may be happy with this number, but the other side of the coin is that the people playing you will be losing 84% of the time; that is, your enjoyment is coming at the expense of other users. 

Like I said, I do have some ideas that might help and will be happy to have a chat with you (discord is best, top link of https://linktr.ee/elevenvr, i'm carrotstien there), you can also facebook chat with me at facebook.com/ElevenVR ) ..but at the end of the day, I'm trying to improve the experience for the majority of the userbase, and not for users trying to (intentionally or not), beat on weaker players. 


Hi Biggzizurpapa,
First of all, thank you very much for the feedback. I am sorry to hear that you have a bad experience with our game after the last update. The whole purpose of this update was to make the life of players easier, as many new players were just waiting in the lobby forever (people felt that inviting someone for the game is like bothering them), so we added the option where you just select your parameters (preferable elo range of your opponents and proximity), and queue for a ranked match that our system will find for you. No more confusion, no more guilt by annoying other people with invites. Congratulations on having 2500 elo, that's pretty high! Also, that is the cause of your problem, 2500 elo is enough to be ranked #285 in the world. This means that there are only 284 players above you, in the whole world, with different timezones, etc. This makes it difficult enough to consistently have matches with people who are higher rated, as there are not many of them, and I am afraid that we had the same problem with the old system. If you get matched with people 400 elo below you, then please try tweaking your quick match settings to have the elo range of your opponents closer to yours, this will prevent you from playing these matches, but can also increase waiting time for a match. When you are saying that you had a match within 20-30 seconds before, was it always ranked? Because we had many complaints that people leave rooms or are toxic when they get matched but their opponent chooses unranked, with the current system we avoid the situation of two people who don't share the same intention in terms of ranked/unranked can get matched. This also saves your time from clicking through invites only to find out that someone doesn't want to play ranked, the system is finding for you the person who is within your expectations (elo range, proximity) and is also willing to play ranked, so theoretically you would get matched with the same person in the end through the invites system, it would just look different, with potential upsets about people accepting your invites and not wanting to play ranked. 
Once again, thank you very much for the feedback, as we value all of the opinions and try to find the solutions that will please as high % of the whole player base as possible. The system is definitely not set in stone yet and will be tweaked to match the requests/problems that we see, as we are trying to maximize the happiness of our players. Have a great day,

"current state : still very much in alpha, but what they've got works pretty well.

pros :
-great projectile physics and hit tracking
-very actively updated, focusing on tournament-style features (shot tracing, etc)
-good map variety and accessible map editor
-bots have been added
-you can wear a hat

cons : 
-maps are limited to 1 level, without any way to make ramps / stairs
-matchmaking is nonexistent, relying only on discord to schedule team vs team games in advance
(having a few open low-ping dedicated servers for people to jump into would go a long way here, guys.)

if you're looking for a normal multiplayer vr gaming experience, maybe wait a bit to pick this one up.  there won't be a match going most of the time, and the devs are still focusing on a scheduled-games-only approach.  you have almost zero chance of finding someone online to play with if your schedule doesn't fit when matches are happening.

if you've been looking for a paintball vr game that won't pair you with kb+mouse users, this is a great option.  even playing against bots is a lot of fun.  if they added a tool to merge jsons and layer maps made in the editor on top of each other to stack obstacles & make structures, i would play it much more than i currently do.

worth $10 or less in its current state, but if you've played paintball irl i guarantee you've spent more than that on overpriced hot dogs anyway so ymmv.",1609368921,3,0,385594

bethesda has been knocking it out of the park with their vr ports (fallout 4, doom and this one) and this is the one that¡¯s most polished on release, probably thanks to it having had a five month head start on psvr. i hope they¡¯re doing these remakes to learn what makes vr and it¡¯s consumers tick and then bringing it natively to elder scrolls vi and fallout 5 and whatever else they¡¯re cooking. that and mirrors so i can see how i look in the game..!

3) you cannot replay after death because you will see a message in large font on screen to remove your headset. so... we must quit in order to play again.... and... then again watch a boring non-skip textual info. crap!

1) give us skip option or remove long intro on each start.

"this game was fun, but it's clearly too soon to charge more then $20 for it. the map seems huge and the trailer makes the game look like incredible fun. but you could never accomplish any of the games climbing feats, flying fights or anything that makes it look cool.

let me break it down, i thought my controller was broken because i could barely walk in a straight line. just the game doing it's thing.

i tried to climb and shoot like the game showed off, ammo capacity and accuracy made it a major waste of time and ammo.

went to revive a friend, turns out it takes way longer then they advertise and they can just walk away from their death spot. which means you have to kill someone for them to even become more then just another target. unless you use your friend as a human shield.

the ring, or zone or box. it moves so often i thought it was modeled after someone's alcoholic aunt, there's no time to loot and go. 

the inventory system restricts you to three items, without single block upgrades. so you can get a combination of, a slow healing item that isn't worth grabbing, a banana which is a decent heal, a grenade or a gun.

speaking of grenades, i can throw further then the characters. but the simplicity of not only a crosshair for hip fire but an arc path for grenades is something more shooters should have, screw immersion i wanna feel cool hitting my target.

ultimately i didn't get very upset at the gameplay, i enjoyed myself and the community was friendly for my short playthrough. but a pattern of getting shot at by a sniper i couldn't see but didn't seem to miss appeared very quickly. this is the same pattern that turned me away from 2d battleroyals so i will speak praise for the game. i just won't play it myself, wait for a sale.

tl;dr the game is fun, the people are nice, don't expect things to turn out like the dramatic trailers and don't plan on winning unless you get a sniper. wait for a sale.",1607755747,0,0,687515

"i want to enjoy this so badly. it's my kind of game, a realistic sandbox based entirely around guns, and it's designed so well it's hard to not recommend. but i just can't when the controls are so obviously designed for the htc vive, an old and outdated headset with very obtuse controls that just can't be mapped very well to an oculus controller. 

there has been some attempt at making the controls friendlier to newer controllers with thumbsticks and no trackpads, but some issues persist, such as the weapon slides being hard to properly pull back as the rift controllers actually have to collide to do so, and the option for smooth locomotion being limited to controller-relativity and not by head orientation. i'm even hearing that the index controls aren't much better. it's a given that a simulator will be harder to get the hang of than an arcade-style vr game with streamlined controls, but in the case of this game, i just spent too much time wrestling with the weapons trying to reload them and getting totally lost on what ammo types work with certain guns (although this was surmountable after finding an option to spawn the ammo for any weapon in hand), and anyone less than a firearms enthusiast might find all this too tiring to deal with. 

it would be a novel idea if the dev could add some kind of 'simple mode' that reduces some of the complicated aspects of the game (like a more beginner-friendly spawn menu). if this and the dated controls ever get addressed, then i'll basically have no complaints.

edit: i got a response from the developer that essentially dismisses my criticisms as things for me to put up with because he deems them non-issues. i will accept that one of them was, but the rest just aren't sufficiently resolved to me, so i stand by my review. i shouldn't have to go to a forum page and be told my criticism's invalid because it's not in line with what other people criticise the game for. read other reviews, mine is not an outlier; the controls are by far the most common complaint in positive and negative reviews. if you own an oculus headset, be aware of the controls, which i thought were janky enough to diminish the experience for me. disappointing to see developers deflect criticism in this manner.",1607316066,2,1,470017

-	the steam description states ¡°compete with friends¡­¡± which in itself, isn¡¯t claiming to be multiplayer, but it¡¯s certainly verging on implying such functionality.

-	steam description states ¡°create your own journey in your path¡­¡± ¨C there are no ¡®choices¡¯ to be made. ¨C i thought there might have been options to create your own burger recipes, or hell, at least to name your burger van¡­ but no.

-	the trailer uses the term ¡®flip burgers¡¯ and the steam description ends on the line keep on flippin¡¯ ¨C there is no ¡®flipping¡¯ of the burgers, the simply cook when on the grill. ¨C yes, this might seem quite an insignificant issue, but when the game is literally cooking burgers, i¡¯d expect to see this functionality in place, especially given the implications within the trailer and description.

-	although the career mode is missing, the game description is at least upfront about this part and states ¡®coming soon¡¯

the game is also lacking another key feature ¨C a menu! there is no way to edit graphics, sounds, position, music or even to exit the game properly. the only way to exit is to open the steam app in your hmd and close that way, which causes a number of problems with steam, which then has to be re-started before the game can be launched again.

but then the developers waanted to squeeze the last bit of profit that they could out of this game. they got rid of the ability to download and play other peoples songs and replaced it with songs you can buy on game. such a garbage move by them.

there are just a few jump scares, which is good, most of the challenge revolves around gathering the courage to move into that new door you have just unlock or go back to that place you had a bad time before never knowing if things will remain the same or if there is something new lurking around.

graphic are pretty good, they are still oculus focused so nothing is hyperrealistic, they knew that so the whole design is pretty well balanced, character have some sort of dishonor-like looks. immersion is not affected at all tho, proportions are good, 0 vr sickness, and you will still punch the air a few time if you get caught...",1621567414,5,Thanks so much for this in depth review!

then there's the menu system where you grab potions. but... i can't always grab them. which leads to me not being able to use the menu. other objects are annoyingly difficult to grab too. the locomotion is pretty much the worst i have experienced, you take weird leaping steps. 

the last straw was a gamebreaking bug that made it so that when i spawned i could not move. nothing i could do, just stuck. when i pulled up the menu i couldn't grab any of the options and i just uninstalled. screw this game.",1590498461,3,3,701780

"this game has alot of potential. but its a buggy mess with terrible controlls and still kinda unpolished. i really like the hardcore setting: if you fuck up you gotta live with it. what i dont like, is loosing alot of hardly grinded stuff to bugs and map errors . (falling through solid ground, getting stuck, then using unstuck button to fall of a cliff or into water (which will kill you and you loose all your stuff forever) and enemies glitching through walls or solid objects to name a few shitty things.)  overall this could be a phenomenal immersive experience like no other in the vr market right now. but not as it is right now.

edit (31.10.20) things work alot better now, alot of issues have been adjusted/fixed and i do not find myself overwhelmed with bugs and glitches anymore. i only have small concerns now, like: an option to adjust the ""holster-help"" range. (if you want to place a weapon in your storage area it gets teleported back into your inventory instead of being placed like you intended)  while not breaking the immersion it is quite a pest and can be annoying, especially if that happens in combat when handling magazines etc. so, as of now i'd say with the new patches and free new content the developer put in the game this is a solid if not unique experience i'd recommend to hardcore shooter fans.",1595790501,3,0,365423

"i've been playing rez since the year 2000 on sega dreamcast, it was always ahead of its time and absolutely made for vr (you would think) this is definitely the best looking version of rez that i've played
and knowing it was being released soon i pulled out the daydream with a lg v30 + which is a 2k+ oled display but compared with quest it really looks bad now. made by exactly the same devs too (absolutely love this port from the dev team it looks so vibrant running on quests 2 oled displays, i'm blown away.
well it's always been an awesome experience and it has just got better since the vr evolution has let it evolve.
absolutely a masterpiece
perfect port as well.
all i can say is if you have never played rez you're missing out on one of the best games ever made.
it's worth every cent.

an hour into the game.
still everything above applies but for some reason the sound in general is just not even close to being loud enough and with rez this is a big deal, now i am using headphones plugged into the quests right headphone jack with scullcandy wired headphones which i use for everything i play or movie i watch on the quest and everything is plenty loud, 
now devs please listen
this port is off the chain i love it, but it definitely needs the sound adjustment some how from your end, now i didn't notice this as much in classic rez but where i was hearing mad beats (but my tv is 8 feet away on low and i could hear it over the quest and this never happens) area x is somehow affected the worse. this does not look as good in the daydream port as it does on quest but the sound from my lg v30+ is in a whole other league via apt x hd bluetooth, while i am on it consider having the analogue stick for movement and button's and or triggers for shooting (like the original version on dreamcast) this would allow everyone to play in the dark without the need for 6dof tracking, as you are well aware of the game plays great with this control system as it's the original and allowing us to play without tracking is a very big deal as we could play in bed in the dark. please consider my feedback as i have played rez since dreamcast days(i still have the dc disc and my dc) as i'm an oldskool gamer.
still love this game but sound is definitely half of the game, it's like a car with no wheels, i'll try my senheisser dj headphones and get back to you, but these are huge cans and loud as f*#k.

ok i just used my big dj headphones and it was much better than my cheaper ones, but still there could be more bass or maybe i am just used to very loud music and games with lots of treble and heaps of bass. 
well i will definitely play rez with these from now on. 
hopefully i can find a fix and i will let you know straight away.

"i really love the goal oriented missions of this meditation application. i love the little characters i love how you're supposed to be growing your meditation strength and you can see that according to how the steps are set up. however ever since i started the third meditation my headset goes to sleep in the middle of that 5 minutes. this is the only application where i am doing meditation or sitting still that my oculus 2 headset just goes to sleep in the middle of my activity. as you can imagine this is not very restful in the middle of a meditation having to keep clicking the power button in order to keep the headset on. so i'm going to end up uninstalling this i would think it's my headset but this is the only application that happens in i also use trip and other than meditation apps as well where i could just sit it does not cut off the headset. 
greetings in response...
yes i do know about the auto sleep settings my auto sleep set is at 5 minutes. i'm unsure as to why i am supposed to go back and forth and specially set my sleep settings on my device specifically for your app. how is that efficient for anyone? i do not have this issue with other meditative apps i have sat and completed a tripp meditation for 30 minutes with no interruption. so again i am just going to uninstall as apparently this app is not for me. i do not do well with inconvenience on my person. what you are stating is an inconvenience that i am supposed to go out of my way for specifically because your app is so awesome? it is awesome it's not awesome enough for me to go back and forth and reset my settings all the time so my device battery does not die on a daily.
best of luck on your future developer endeavor. no response required.

We've seen that this headset issue is usually related to the auto-sleep settings on the Oculus. You might try the following: Quick Settings (where the clock is shown on your menu bar) > Settings (gear icon)> Device> Power (select longer timeframe).

Hoping this can resolve the issue. Please let us know. :)",299109

beyond the fact that it¡¯s a lot of fun, the realistic approach pushes you physically, henceforth making it a hell of a good work out. 1 match had me breathing a bit heavy. 2 had me slightly winded. the 3rd match had me sweating at 3am in the morning. on top of that there¡¯s a punching bag mode to practice on where you can see the amount of power you put into your punches, which makes for a fun little competition if you¡¯ve got friends around.

if one of these two gripes i had were remedied, it'd be a positive review, but as it stands i don't see myself playing this game again beyond basic interaction with weapons.



further info on index controls;
? reloading many weapons results in hitting controllers together or crushing fingers
? no finger tracking, or physical hands beyond the developer actively making a joke about it by making working sausage fingers that are insanely large.

the physics in the game are sublime, but i kind of wish there was a level creator or mod support so i could get even more scenrios to play in.  fighting in this game with melee is awsome, the weight that the items have tricks your head into holding them like they were real, so you end up using stuff like it has weight so you stay in sync with the physics and item.

they didn't even bother to change the default pc keyboard icons, so the game keeps telling you to pres ""t"" or ""x"" when these don't even exist on this platform.
things that imo should obviously be touch-based in vr are still click-based in the same old way. i mean, what's the point of having a touch stone that you have to get close to and press the trigger button to activate, insteaad of... you know... touching it. the same goes for closed boxes and many other menus and click-based interactions. 
the fighting is very clunky in comparison to other vr fighting sinulators and it honestly just amazes me they charge full price for this version of the game, when obviously no work whatsoever was put into it.

"3.8 out of 10

well this game is just a few weeks old and i picked it up in a indie vr bundle. multiplayer is dead, so the main selling point, well, there isn't one. few vr games can hold a mp playerbase, and certainly this game was doomed from day one in this respect.

visually simple, cartoon graphics match with basic textures and colours. the gameplay is okay, but flying around feels awkward. though that doesn't damage the game much, it's mostly trying to pick off the other players so there's no fancy maneuvering when you've lined them up in your sights (well bots, as that who you'll play against).

even if i could find other players, the game just lacks excitement, there's just no personaility or inspired driving force anywhere to be found. this game just exists for the sake of existing and has already sunk to obscurity off it's own merits. 

as a game idea it's fine. the implentation of the idea isn't spectular. so in summary, average production quality and no players. worth ¡ê10.99, no sir!",1503764621,0,0,503068

however, there is many little things killing it.
1- voice recognition support
you should definitly give a process to make it work for everyone, i've spent 2 hours to find where my problem came from. for non-native english users, we have to download the english voice recognition pack and activate it by default.
even if i have a very good and fluent english accent, i have to repeat 3/4 times each questions, taking a neutral and loud voice breaking the immersion. it's a shame :/
2- spatial game area recognition
i've been litteraly playing from the left of the table, midget sized since the oculus position reset doesn't work with the game. i should have been inside a wall to be well positionned in the table ...
3- it's too obvious that the characters are 2d and between each questions, the jump cut isn't natural at all.
5- what about more cards at the same time to ask questions being more free ? what about the characters asking us questions to make us think also ?
if all of these suggestions are incorporated, it could be one of the mandatory experience on the rift.

"[h1]experienced on the oculus quest 2[/h1]

you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/aalb7xq1nhu

so this is a drawing game that has two different modes. the main mode is your physics puzzler where you draw lines or place blocks to guide the ball through the obstacle course. you have an incentive to draw as few lines as possible to reach a higher score for the leaderboards. the second mode is just a sandbox mode where you can draw. 

unfortunately, i can't recommend this game because of several issues. one of the biggest issues is the lack of content. there are only 9 levels, which i beat in less than 30 minutes. the second major issue are the poor interactions. you guide the ball through the obstacle course using a virtual joystick that is unwieldy to use. every interaction in this game is poor and the game just lacks overall polish. it's also ugly to look at. 

the puzzles aren't that interesting and for some reason, i am the only person who has beaten the 9th level. it's not that difficult so i imagine other players quit because they were too bored maybe. the freestyle drawing is also pretty bad with poor controls and it's just too basic a drawing game. 

i know this game is budget priced, but i can't recommend a game that has this many flaws. i maybe would give a neutral 5/10 if it had been free. honestly, this should have been a demo. maybe with a lot more content & a lot more polish, this could be worth recommending at a higher price. as is, it's a no from me.

"i was expecting a game with a storyline, but after playing this game for 30 minutes and dying and then realizing i was just gonna have to play the same 30 minutes over and over again until i beat it i realize that maybe this doesn¡¯t have the content that i thought. add save points, games where you start over every single time you mess up are cheap. it¡¯s like saying we didn¡¯t have enough unique content to bring you so we¡¯re just gonna make you play the same stuff over and over again.",1599362614,5,"Thank you for your feedback, while it might feel like starting over, in each run you've probably unlocked new enemies, new arrows, maybe even new areas in the game.

thus far, i am a ""mighty deity"" 6 out of 7 score.  it appears that you have an infinite world you can build, but management of such a large world seems like it would be challenging to say the least.

i love seeing the new towns being created by new humans being born due to your creating the resourceful lands for them to cultivate.  i have even see large communities being developed in what looks close to antarctica, but you just need to surround your iceland with the right resources to get the town to develop.  the same holds true in deserts, swamps, etc.

my only constructive criticism is that i wish there was an easier way to find those pesky heretics.  i have so many cities now, that i do not have time to search all of them to find 1 heretic.  then they quickly develop into 6 heretics, and then my world is ruined.  this prevents me from expanding my world much larger, because then the heretics talk it over.  developer, if you see this, please fix.

"the claims of ""open world"" are a bit of an exaggeration. in each map you have several islands that are connected with an ice field that you skate around by moving your arm in whatever direction. the islands mostly look the same though (there's only 1 biome basically) and the only thing that really changes is your abilities and the strength of the enemies that you face. you can visit them in any order you like, but there's really no reason to go to one if you're not being sent there as part of the current campaign mission.

so in a nutshell, it's fun, with some really innovative abilities (by the end of it you're basically flying around like a super hero), but hasn't got much replay value after you've experienced everything the game has to offer.

"this is a neutral/mixed review. at the moment i'm trying to decide if i want to keep it or if i want to refund it.

this is not exactly a ""cooking sim"". it is more of a physical sandbox + knife simulator with some predefined ingredient types and predefined interactions.

basically, you can cut things into pieces, you can stuff things into oven, and watch the bars fill till they're ""cooked"". a dish is a checklist of actions to perform. for example, in the tutorial order you place a trout on cutting board, pour some seasoning onto it, stuff it into oven, and then place the cooked trout onto table, then add several lemon slices, and some herb on top. what actions do you perform? aim species at the trout, carry things around, cut the lemon into equal pieces, and place it all onto a plate.

so, to summarize: cut, carry, place. that's it. well, you can also mix liquids. 

you can also make soup out of many ingredients and stuff things into blender which will produce a ""blend"". sometimes results are odd, for example, ""boiled potato + hand blender"" produces pure water. i expected a puree, to be honest...

there's no dough/flour. you can't make bread, cakes, and so on. the original had a dlc for that, but it isn't here.
you also don't peel potatoes, for example. 

the recipes also do not really use real life cooking time, and even though there was a talk about adding real life reference times, that apparently didn't make it into the game.

so, basically what the game does is giving you a checklist for each order and judges you based on how well you followed the checklist. aside from that you have a physics sandbox and can mess around with it, for example, by stuffing gas canister into the oven and making a fire.

but you can't really experiment and have the game recognize the mess you made as a dish. so, if you wanted to make bread, you can't. if you wanted to take the bread and turn into kvass, you can't (no black bread for that anyway). cutlets? nope. potato moonshine? nope. peel potatoes/carrots? nope! make ground meat? nope! (as far as i can tell, no meat grinder in there). how about a chicken? there's no chicken. well, there's chicken breast (apparently?) and you buy chicken broth as an ingridient. but there's no whole chicken. how about icecream? well.. nope? although you can mix some stuff and pretend, i guess...

so that's the core of the game, pretty much. you precisely cut stuff, you have a knife simulator for cutting stuff, you can sorta pour liquids into pots and make soup, but in general the game is about making soup, and placing things onto plates in a physical sandbox. oh, and you can make a mess, blow everything up and start a fire, i guess.

you decide if this is what you want or not.",1627663731,3,1,399927

"this is by far the best vr game of its type (in my relatively limited experience). the physics are excellent, especially during combat. although there is relatively little included content (only a modest number of weapons and maps), the physics and general gameplay make it the perfect environment to build upon with mods, which there is no shortage of.

things i like:
- combat physics: unlike other sword-fighting vr games, the swords behave exactly as expected irl. the amount of force put into a strike determines how it behaves. a light slash will do moderate damage, but probably cannot cut through light armors, but a hard chop will. a strike with the flat of a sword will do little damage, but could cause enemies to stumble. this is just one example of the excellent combat mechanics.
- immersive environments: many loose objects in the environment can be picked up or thrown. enemies can be damaged by smashing them into loose objects or the map itself. walls with angles or edges can be climbed.

things i don't like:
- lack of custom wave editor: you cannot spawn custom waves; you can only choose from a list of provided waves with predetermined amounts of enemies alive at one time and in total. at this time, this game is mostly a fantasy style sandbox-game, so a feature like this would be nice.
- i've been having some performance issues (low framrate) in some situations (like trying to play on maps with lots of loose objects), but that could just be my setup.

the few complaints i mentioned are very minor. i cannot stress enough how good this game is.",1704739881,0,,155572605

"before buying i was skeptical. the ""time moves when you move"" tagline seems like they are trying to combine strategy with fps, which rarely made sense. but oh boy was i in for a treat.

superhot vr is a really fresh and clever take on the decades-old fps genre. everyone dies in one hit, but you can dodge bullets matrix-style, as well as block them with your weapons or even your own bullet. the game challenges you to dodge or block (in slow motion most of the time) dozens of bullets shot at you, while looking for openings to shoot back. the ""time moves when you move"" concept ensures you can easily freeze time to look around and plan your next moves.

one thing i don't like, however, is that whenever i shoot, time moves forward in a short burst. a bullet may be ten meters away from me, but as soon as i fire a shot, that bullet is now in my face. i have no idea why they decide to do this, as it discourages me from shooting in this already difficult game.

"if you like hardcore history, this is an amazing telling. dan carlin has an incredible voice and way of wording that makes narration thought provoking, imaginative, and informative. many narrators tell stories at you, where dan immerses you. the telling, the quotes, and now the images together are likely the closest you'll get to that sought after: 'is this what i would be thinking, or feeling, if i were there right now?'. certainly so within the confines of your home.
this takes us one step closer to the 'being there', or downloading a memory and reliving someone else's experience. 

the good: it's dark, it's gloomy, and it's emotional. a welcome addition to my steam collection, and the price can't be beat.
the bad: it's short, and i didn't do it my first vr experience. i'm so used to vr now that i've lost some of that initial magic. i wish i could go back, and do this before i did anything else. 

words of advice: 
technology advice: turn off your chaperone, and change your background to black. you won't be moving around, and if either pops up it takes you out of the moment. 
and
listen to hardcore history's: blueprint for armageddon. it is very long, 6 episodes at about 3-4 hours each. but you may notice many of the little details in the telling of the history are subtly included here, and the detailed background of these fleeting moments adds something to them.

"[h1]experienced on the oculus rift with touch controllers[/h1]

you can watch my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/cmay4-bljnq

this game is up there with gorn and blade and sorcery as among the best arena fighters in vr. i would say this is a nice compromise between the arcade action of gorn and the simulation combat of blade & sorcery. not only that, but what really separates this game from other arena fighters is just how gorgeous it is. each of the arenas / environments look good and the enemy models look excellent and even their animations are good for the most part.

dismembering enemies has never felt this satisfying. you can smash their faces in with blunt weapons or slice them off with an axe. or slowly cut them up into pieces with a sword. at this time, there are only 3 melee weapon types: blunt weapons, axes, or swords (1 handed, 1.5 handed, or 2 handed). you unlock better versions as you go along ... with the best usually being bigger 2 handed versions. you can also use shields or potions (health, poison, frost, or fire) and choose which armor to use (from light armor all the way to plate armor). 

each weapon feels different. i personally preferred the blunt weapons. my early favorite was the kanabo but then i fell in love with the great hammer. i do think that blunt weapons are much better than axes or swords in this game just because they deal with armored enemies much better (shields or plated enemies). i also think that using a shield just slows you down, especially after you unlock a pure 2 handed weapon.

enemies are either of the undead or skeleton type. they vary in armor (plated, shielded, no armor) and weapons they carry. unfortunately, other than the boss fights or mini-bosses, it really didn't seem to matter what weapon they had. what kind of armor or shield they had was usually much more important. you're looking for weak spots to dispatch enemies quickly. i don't believe i ever had more than 2 enemies in the arena at once. 

while i did enjoy the combat and it was fun for the most part, it did get a little repetitive towards the end. i stuck with one strategy for the whole game - hit enemies as soon as you see an opening and if you see they are about to strike, quickly move away, wait for them to finish their attack animations, then attack again and rinse and repeat. there are traps at the edges of the arena such as ground spikes or moving blades that do add a bit of excitement to the normal combat. 

there are four boss fights. they were enjoyable, but not especially difficult, especially if you use potions and have a good weapon. i think i only died three times during the entire game on normal difficulty. whole thing took me about 4 hours to complete. there are four main arenas and several rounds, including bonus arena levels (new arenas). i have not tried hardcore mode yet (but i do plan to do that in the future). i got a little bit of a workout, but i didn't really break too much of a sweat. while the combat isn't as complex or in-depth as dark souls, it still feels very satisfying in vr and way more immersive. 

[b]rate 8/10. i bought this on sale during the steam winter sale for $19.99 usd and think it's a great deal for the price. this game is among the best of its genre for vr. [/b]",1577253344,3,1,370325

you have to remap your brain a bit, but very quickly you'll get used to the hubris movement and controls.  i'm a stealth shooter gamer and it feels great to actually physically having to aim my weapon.  every tiny tremor in your aim, will lose you bullets, but also makes it far more rewarding.  still learning the cover mechanics.  climbing is cool. first time ever your hand placement was relevant. if you run in any game, you don't have to worry where your feet are. climbing in hubris makes you feel connected to the environment. even this felt intuitive after a while.

the graphics work amazing in combination with the oculus and controllers.  objects are crisp and physical, good lighting, good atmosphere, good immersion.  not overly rendered, but for me this is fine, it supports the gameplay.  
an oculus is a big investment (i borrowed one) but playing this game, i get it now.  very curious to explore more of hubris.

most of the game play i have seen was eh but dont let watching someone lazily swing a virtual blade around deceive you, you can swing your weapons as fast as you like but the wider you swing the more damage you do works kinda like beat saber. you dual wield 2 weapons from a small variety of 1 handed blades and axes. there are multiple special abilities to give you an advantage when fighting such as making yourself briefly invincible, put enemies in stasis so you can deal with others etc stuff like that. there is a variety of enemies to fight from weak troops to heavily armored knights. think of it something like a vr rogue like dungeon crawler of sorts you clear a room of enemies get yourself a buff of some type go to the next room rinse repeat. all in all so far i love the game and highly recommend it. 10/10",1609726157,0,0,730491

"it is basically a dungeon-crawler with working physics and magical items and of course nice abilities. 
you start off with 10 ability points you can allocate to strength, dexterity and intelligence, what this influence will be shown when you look at each one. but it is classic so dexterity is for daggers and bows and spears, strength for shields, swords and axes and the like, and intelligence is mostly for magic! 
the graphics are nice, the controlls work very fluent and if my graphics card were a little bit better, i would have gotten more out of the game allready. you can throw fireballs, lightningstrikes, heck you can throw your axe and sword at the enemies (which by the way consist of skeletons and goblins for now, but more variety will come at a later point so) the game is not really that much repititive as the levels are randomly put together and the enemies differ too, sometimes you get to see a lot of skellies, sometimes a lot of goblins, and sometimes you get a bigger, more powerfull one of the two, that even uses magic or stronger melee abilities as enemies...
there is a ""town"" where you return to after you finished a level or die, and that reminds me veeery much of diablo 1, to be honest. the game feels like a vr ported diablo 1, and it does that very good so far. alos bonus-points for the fact that you can play together with other players, so you can play with some friends in one dungeon, and hunt for loot and bigger enemies!

you might be thinking, ""it doesn't seem like there's any reason to have tower defense in vr,"" but you can really get into the action of the game. part of what helps is that you're not just staring at the board the whole time, you can use powers like literally throwing fireballs, moving a warrior anywhere on the board, and even taking control of some of the castle's own defenses to help.

this game also has a ton of gameplay for the price, especially if you're trying to 3 star every level. there are about 15 levels, broken up into 3 zones each with their own enemies and defensive powers. if you're a fan of tower defense games, this game guarentees a bang for your buck.",1504266756,0,0,521859

"[h1]experienced on the meta quest 3[/h1]

you can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/sl1lfltgo_o

i don't think this is a good game, but i also don't think it's a bad game. it's just pretty generic and forgettable, which may be worse in some ways. it also has pretty out-dated vr mechanics, especially for 2025. i heard this game was several years in development and it shows. this game may have been fine in 2017 pcvr, but not in 2025.

the combat is subpar. it has move your flintlock towards your ammo pouch for auto reload! then it has skeletons running straight towards you. they spawn out of thin air in waves. this game feels like the worst of the wave shooters from 2017. a real step backward for steam vr.

the climbing is okay. it kind of reminds me of a temu or wish version of horizon call of the mountain. it's just climbing done competently, but it's just too repetitive at the end of the day. you just climb, then climb some more, somehow it feels like you're not going anywhere fast. there's a stamina system that i never noticed because it didn't effect my gameplay in any way.

the puzzles are also pretty uninspired. a lot of just looking for stuff. you are either tying to find an object or looking for signs to follow the correct order of things. generic puzzles that are too basic with almost no creativity. the story was so forgettable that i'm unable to tell you anything about it. the voice overs were okay, but the parrot was annoying because it kept repeating phrases. i wanted to and did finally shoot it, but i found out if do kill it then it's like you died so don't do it!

game is running on the unreal engine 4. on my rtx 3080, i was getting mostly 90 fps. i did run into some bugs that cause me to be soft-locked but simple resets saved the day. check points are not very generous though. the game lacks overall polish, with an ugly ui with coins showing that ruin any immersion along with an inventory system that is ugly. you have full locomotion, along with smooth or snap turning, height adjustment, along with button crouch, so you can play comfortably seated. camera is either controller or head directed.

overall, the game took me exactly 3.9 hours to beat, and that is with having to repeat certain sections due to bugs. i wanted to quit after 2 hours, but found the wherewithal to keep going. i did not have fun, but it's an okay game, mostly solidly made. i think sometimes generic, forgettable games though are the worst kind of sin you can do as a developer. 

[b]rate 6/10. i wouldn't recommend this game to a friend, but to you steam vr stranger, i give it a tepid thumbs up.[/b]

"if holopoint is the game that will make you hate the vive's breakout box, holoball is the game that will make you hate its wrist straps. i personally haven't had any experiences with anyone letting go of the controller yet, but i've seen plenty of evidence elsewhere, and it's a bit telling that nintendo has suddenly sold out of every color of wrist strap except the basic white, so if you don't always keep a good grip or know someone who might not be too careful then you might want to get a beefier wrist strap before you play this one. 

as for the game itself, it's simple but fun, like most of the cheaper vive games i've played. it's sort of like pong mixed with tennis, in which you play against an ai. if you've got a spectator they can also take over the ai and play with wasd, but in my experience they won't stand a chance and it's better to just leave it to the computer. there are four difficulties that you unlock as you complete the previous one, and it can be a pretty good workout on the later difficulties. it's not necessarily the sort of thing that's super impressive on a technological level, but for the price it offers a fair amount of entertainment unless you manage to break your wrist strap, in which case the only people being entertained may be the tv repair company.",1462520368,3,0,478879

"alright, i just finished every ending, i'll do my best to edit this into an unbiased review.

first things first, the 'endings' are only endings in name. you'll get your first 'ending' only a few hours into the game, having explored only a tiny fraction of the game's rooms and puzzles, and each ending shows you a piece of the storyline underlying last labyrinth.


pros:

+katia is adorable, and while the game could have been played on a flat monitor, there's something about looking a 3d katia in the eyes and feeling like she's present in the room with you that makes it 100x more stressful when she's in danger.

+the later puzzles are amazing, and usually fill me with the kind of satisfaction that only overcoming a very difficult obstacle can provide. if you get really stuck, i recommend taking off your headset for a while and surfing the internet while you think. it might be a little hypocritical of me to say this, since i wrote the 'stuck guide', but you will lose out on the satisfaction if you allow yourself to become frustrated or if you look up the answer. if you do use my guide, i highly recommend only revealing the spoilers if you're re-doing a puzzle and just want to get it over with.

+the way that the storyline is presented is amazingly well done. each ending gives you just enough information that, like a puzzle all its own, you can deduct more and more about what really happened with each ending that you see. putting together the storyline is last labyrinth's final (and most difficult) puzzle.

cons:

-no chapter select. there's one part of the game where 4 endings branch off of it. this means that you need to do both of the puzzles between the starting room and the endings four times, since you can't just skip to the end. if you're impatient, you'll hate it, and there's just no reason to have to do it since the puzzles never change.

-the first train room is unsolvable until you die to it, as there's no way to know that the train will flip the tracks when it runs over them, and you don't know if the flags are supposed to be up or down (they're supposed to be up).

-the game seems a little chaotic at first, i think the developers could have done a better job of conveying what is a sequence of events and what is an ending. when i started playing, i was unsure if the 'cliffs' scenes were endings, or if only times when credits roll are endings. having finished the game now, i mostly understand what the game is trying to convey (but i'm still trying to piece together the final bits of the storyline), and i feel that the chaos may have been intentional.


in conclusion, i think that if you want a challenge, and the price doesn't put you off ($40 at the time of this review), you should definitely play last labyrinth, especially if you enjoy the kind of game that's good at sneakily revealing a secret underlying story without being in your face about it.

if the price is a lot of money to you, or you're unsure if you'd like it, remember that you can try it out. as long as you don't put more than 2 hours into the game, steam will let you refund it if you decide it's not for you.",1573872060,4,0,751619
"this game is really fun, it is very simular to space pirate trainer but more bullet-hell to it. i think it is way worth the price and i am excited to see were it goes.",1482533513,0,0,492942
"yeah, it's alright. great production values, especially for the price. animations are a bit lacking, but he guns and enviroments are great. the gameplay is a bit tedious though. might just be a low level thing (there are many perks and catagories to level), but zombies are stupidly spongy, taking many headshots to drop. the game devolves pretty quickly into kiting around a mass of slow moving unthreatening mobs while your overpriced ammo dwindles. ammo is stupid expensive. 200 rounds costs as much as a gun, and with how much it takes to drop the horde it becomes a nagging annoyance. time between waves is too short, i'd give the players a trigger for the next wave, or at least increase the time between by like 50%. gave up on the 4th wave of the second level out of boredom. still, worth 7 bucks anyway. will probably come back to it at some point.",1503186323,0,0,684627

We are of the opinion that aiming with the Gear VR controller is not actually the way the real combat works (unless you are in a western movie) it's only useful for games where you stand still and shoot zombies that are going at you otherwise aiming with your sight is much better. Besides Gear VR controller is really limited in buttons so it will make aiming while walking, jumping and pausing really difficult.

"hello. avid boneworks player here
first off, i'm completely fine with this game. i am happy i got myself a copy after all this time since boneworks came out and i would have to say that the game is good! however, i wish to point out some things that i dislike before i go onto the things i like.

bad bad very bad.
i wish the campaign was a bit more meaty. what they do with it is absolutely incredible, it feels like a very big tech demo. the mine cart section is a sight for sore eyes, but the fact is that you literally don't have to do anything in it is kinda crungo. 1/3 of the levels are just tutorials for the different body types, which i don't exactly mind, but i wish they did more with the extra body types apart from their introduction and a subsequent and obligatory ""final level"".

crane don't work. oh god it doesn't fucking work.

needs another enemy that actually picks up objects or grabs things. 

i completely understand the faults of the game. there are parts of it that are complete and utter jank. whether that be the fault of the engine or the controller you are using. you just have to realize that this game is relatively new and experimental.

but

and this is a big but.
absolutely massive.
it just feels like y'all mfs give up way too easily. 
lemme tell you a story. in the titular level ""bonelab"", you are expected to go into every single doorway and do a mission or minigame in order to activate a ungrabable power sphere thing. with this power sphere, you're expected to go to the bottom center of the lab and use a crane to move said spheres into ports. literally impossible for someone who's crane is literally in itself and can't lower! however, despite all my rage and me trying to manually move it with my player model, i was hit with an epiphany. looking back at boneworks, i remembered how i managed to beat the hover junkers level. i literally didn't know how to fly the thing because i refused to learn how to control it. getting hit once in the level meant that i most likely had to restart from the beginning and have to fly another half an hour to even get close to completing it. only then i realized that boneworks isn't the type of game where you have to do something in a very specific way to succeed. so, with all my combined brainpower of two and a half braincells, i came up with a solution. attaching anti gravity pads to the hover cart thing and flying it from there.
and guess what.
it worked.
my dumbass idea actually worked and i ended up finishing the level without ever having to figure out how to control the goddamn hover craft!!!
using the same logic, i decided to go out and collect some tools from the minigames (they aren't hard to find if you do some basic secret hunting, and if you can't find them then search them up on youtube or something lol), and using both the anti gravity pad and the wall climber things, i managed to move all the spheres on foot and bring them to their ports.
this was probably not the intentional way to do it. there's a god damned crane that's supposed to do it. but using the crane is boring and tedious when it does work. that's the beauty of bonelab. i don't have to do shit how the devs wanted me to!!! i can do what ever the fuck i want without even grabbing a gun!
i just think the modern gamer nowadays gives up on things way too quickly at the slightest incovenience. the exact moment when someone isn't hit with dopamine is when they go ""this game fucking sucks"" and they drop it.
with that rant out of the way, lets get to the-


good shit
avatar customization is cracked. this is like vr chat but i can actually throw somebody like a rag doll when i have a body that's broly tier. this comes with the upsides and downsides that are present with having a body that large! you'll get shit stuck to you like how it would be stuck in real life!

this game's problems are non linear. unlike alyx where there's a expected and unavoidable solution to every problem in the game, bonelab operates on a system that's entirely designed to replicate stuff in real life. if i want to get a thing that's up high, i can stack boxes to get to them!!! with the addition of new body types however, this becomes even more interesting as every body provides new and different challenges!

the game just came out. it's in its infancy. with the addition of modding, this game has a theoretical infinite amount of gameplay potential. give it some time.

i found it difficult to play the game modes alone where you either fight waves of ai gunmen or zombies. whether you play these game modes alone or with folks online, the longer you survive, the harder it gets! headshots wont mean anything after a while, and you'll have to dump mags into their faces before they drop. the timeline between waves should be spent upgrading/buying ammo or weapon upgrades, but you're given less than a minute to do this at the designated locations. 

i prefer playing the sandbox solo games where you create your battle type with ai. you can create your own team and opposing force (5 guys max for either team). the maps are pretty small, so it works out. there's also a lot of user content, so if you fancy replaying some goldeneye 007 maps, have fun!",1672031384,0,,129308533

ideas for devs:
- please add more weapons or make a workshop kinda like what steam has but different. like not to be connected to a computer but just a addons to be added to the game by a website or the workshop idea i thought of.
- please, please fix the bug where if the enemy your weapon, it gets stuck for a bit which makes alot of noises, then sometimes flings your weapon.
- add more moves the a.i can do. it gets boring very quickly know what the a.i every moves are.

"this is one of the most interesting genres i'd like to see being developed for vr. first person fighting games have so much potential.  this game, while basic in nature.. is still a really great idea.. block high and low, punch high and low.. provide a move similar to a super move in most fighting games and add multiplayer (which they did) and in theory, you would have a great game, providing you had great controls.  

well.. i like what they did here and what i would love to see is a slightly tighter control when it comes to hit detection and maybe show an invisible shield when you're blocking high and low so you know you activated block. i'd like to see more fighters and the ability to select different fighters (with different super moves of course). if they tighten up the contols a bit more and add a bunch of extra fighteres, i'd be happy to pay for that extra content as long as they don't go the route of capcom.. 

for what we have here thus far, i think its worth the 15 bucks (sale price currently, as of this review) just to give yourself a chance to try a 1st person vr fighter for the first time. the dev did something cool here.. and i'd love to see more as it has the potential to be great.

Hi!

I would like to let you know that, from the time of your review, a considerable amount of time has elapsed. In this time, a lot of improvements have been made to the game.

For example, on the 24th of September, we released an update in which we added a multiplayer co-op campaign mode. 

Now, you can play the game together with friends.

We have a lot of other cool updates on our roadmap, and these updates will be free for existing players.

For example:

1. Close combat;
2. Horde mode;
3. A new chapter.

Should you like it, we would appreciate it if you might increase your rating for our game.

Should you have any further questions, you can always write us at info@dream-dev.com.

Thank you very much!

"i am not impressed with this game, and this is solely because of the fact that most of the guns in this game feel so wrong and incorrect. there are only 3 gun sounds for like 50 different weapons, and many of the parts to the guns can not be interacted with. for example, the rear sight on the bar can not be flipped up or adjusted. there are problems with weapon scaling, too. the ppsh 41's width is way too flat; it looks like it was ran over by a t34. the stg44 is much too long, etc. if you shoot the paper target enough in the sandbox shooting range, bullet holes begin to disappear! i understand that the oculus quest is not a very powerful workhorse when it comes to specs, but it really shows in this game. attachments are unrealistic and feel more like a gimmick than something that aids in accuracy. most attachments are downright incorrect, such as the c79's scope crossheirs for an example. the developers do not update nearly enough, and it seems like there are times when they forget about this game altogether despite it being one of the most popular games on the quest. it would be a lie to say that i haven't had fun playing this game, and although there are a few weapons that feel genuine (such as the uzi), this game does not come close to replacing h3vr. if you really want a shooting game like this, i'd recommend it, but just barely. i, personally am very disappointed in this game.",1590981814,5, ,162985

"do you hate guns? do you hate the ideology that guns make people safer? do you love satiracal humor? then this is absolutely the game for you! the american dream, a game set in the 1950s that sees every man, woman, and child in america using guns as the solution to everything is just as hillarious as the trailers let on. sprinkled throughout the game, despite it's 50s setting, are many gags and jokes centered around all the absurd excuses gun-nuts use to keep their beloved firearms. 

i won't spoil too much, but the ending boss battle even makes it rewarding to die, providing you with really amazing quotes by very influential figures (even those like abraham lincoln) about the dangers of a society so fixated on it's firepower. yes, the game is very politically charged, and if you are someone who loves guns, said ending will probably upset you because it will tell you things you probably don't want to hear.

the team that made this game lives in austrailia, a nation that passed strict gun control laws in 1996 after a massacre that killed 35 people and wounded 23 others. ever since, they have had one of the fewest gun violence rates in the world. usa, on the other hand, is the outlier. this game comes from a country that reigned in the problem of gun violence over 20 years ago, so they look at the gun culture of the us with baffled amazement, but also understanding of why it exists: fear. fear of foreigners, fear of the government and fear of your neighbor.

that said though, the game also doesn't defend any idealistic dreams often held by anti-gun liberals either. it doesn't pretend that if we banned guns that we would get rid of all gun violence. austrailians know this firsthand due to the incident in 1996 not being the last time anyone ever got hold of or used a gun, with one of the most recent examples being the 2014 sydney hostage crisis. they merely ask that we as americans not be so lax about it. don't let just anyone get a gun out of fear or anger. keep better track of our guns (there is actually an entire level in the game entirely dedicated to that last point). make sure we know who is buying guns and why. otherwise, the truth of the real world might end up even more insane than the world depicted in this game.

if you are anti-gun, you are going to love this game and it's message. however, even if you are someone who does currently support gun ownership, as long as you have an open mind (something incredibly lacking in modern society, hell even i have been known to not have a very open mind), you should still give this game a try. you might learn a little something.

i got this game on sale for 15% off, but even at it's full retail price it's worth the money. do keep in mind though that it is a seated experience only and sometimes features long winded bits of narration/video. i usually found the narration and video to be funny and enjoyable, but i've seen other people in reviews for this game complain about it so i figured i'd bring it up here. there have also been a few audio and performance bugs i've encountered, but most of them have been quickly patched by the developers (who were actually nice enough to respond to my email about my technical issues personally) and the ones that still remain are usually easily worked around.

this is easily my most favorite indie game ever made and i eagerly look forward to what this developer puts out in the future.

"i haven't put a whole lot of time into this game, mostly because i don't necessarily have the play space i want for my setup, but what little i have played takes me to a whole new place that i want to explore, and i actually feel like i'm there. the combat system is fun and interesting; plus the exploration is a blast.
if you're looking for a new world to get lost in for vr, i'd recommend this game.
it should be noted that i play this on the quest 2, over air link, with a rtx 2080. i do encounter some visual tearing occasionally, but it's not unbearable in my opinion. probably just need to tweak my settings some more",1669197226,0,,126264720

"interim review

i am not sure whether i will be able to play this game and so cannot recommend at present. the controls are so clumsy compared to todays games.  i have an oculus rift s and with modern games i am used to smooth rotation to find the direction i want and then either a smooth teleport or natural walk option to get to where i want to be.  these modern controls are so subtle that its easy to forgot your in a game and that's how it should be.   however the controls for this game are very clumsy, i have to press the joystick in and then rotate to where i want to go and make sure that i then orientate the direction i want to face in and its not a natural flow of movement and not very accurate and so everytime i want to move and explore its a chore that i am not sure i can be bothered to endure. i am reminded everytime that i am in a game thats hard to control and thats no fun :(

"[h1][b]half life: alyx will push the future of vr forward[/b][/h1]

i do not need to make a lengthy review to tell you that half life alyx is a masterpiece. everything about half life alyx has been perfected and implemented in a way to make yourself fully immersed. the gameplay is great and the story matches it. 

there were some glitches and minor things that i can overlook to make it my first 10/10, but there is a issue that makes it lower. it is obvious that smooth locomotion was a afterthought. there is no sprint feature, no jumping, or crouching (unless you physically crouched) in smooth locomotion. another vr game that i take fondness to, boneworks, has these features and i can say that i am spoiled by them as the smooth locomotion features in here are not representative of fast, high action gameplay but more like the walking speed of a resident evil 1 character. 2/4 bugs i encountered were also smooth locomotion related too, adding on to the unpolished and rushed movement style. if i were a teleport only player this would be an easy 10/10, but i'm not.

i hope either valve or the modding community can fix half life: alyx smooth locomotion, but everything else is perfect.

there's one quick story line that takes you thru a handful of areas. just a few weapons. there's also a side story as a jedi that's apparently in 4 parts, but the core game only unlocks the 1st. on the menu it actually shows there are 3 more but doesn't explain you have to buy the dlc to play them, so it feels even more incomplete when you finished the main story line and you're stuck wondering why that won't progress.

if you ever loved magic the gathering and yu-gi-oh, this is your time. the cards pop into fun 3d, animated avatars who are ready to battle. there are daily quests, card packs begging to be opened, rewards to be collected, beta-testers to oogle at, actual attentive mods, and relaxing fun to be had.

i honestly cannot praise the game experience enough, and we've much more ahead of us as players down the road.",1647831977,0,0,414275

"i just bought this and have to give it some praise.  in short, i'd say its a lot of fun.  the guns are particularly good, and they all have unique (but fairly simple) reloading mechanics.  i found myself fumbling to reload a few times under pressure, but it did get easier as i played on.  you can also carry two weapons and swap between them quickly, which can be quite useful.

i liked the game's art, music, and style in general - it really reminds me of old 90s fps games i used to play growing up,  i also love how you can shoot and break just about everything.  there are some pretty amazing propaganda posters all over the place too (add more of these!!!)

it's early access so content is limited.  that's the only downside i see here.  for me its a worthy cause to support, so i'll be keeping an eye on this one",1530582977,0,0,611553

"i have just took a shot (in a tournament none the less) i used a 4 iron i hit it nice and smooth i stepped forward before taking the shot so th club would come down on the ball more and create more of a driven shot if anything yet the ball went almost straight up in the air and the ball travelled 110 yards into a hazard and these shots happen a lot please enable the game to read opening and closing of club face plus the difference on a lofted shot and a driven shot. on this game you must stand the same on every shot and swing the same on every shot and adjust your shot only by changing club.... very poor ruined my first tournament thanks for that. the game could be amazing i do enjoy it most of the time but it has a lot to be desired. and also i have entered two tournaments and it won't give me a ball. i entered the back nine easy tournament and no ball no matter what i did couldn't get a ball exited went on to full 18 tournament next too it and still no ball come on guys very frustrating and this game has so much potential..


thanks for your reply.

i would increase as i can see the game has developed and is better but it still lacks as sometimes it reads you opening the club face and sometimes it doesn't you can clearly see on the screen you open the face yet it has no effect and the ball travels the same. also the ball turns on a flat green when putting i have a video of this it's even on my fb page. the arrows on the putting green reading system should be smaller and travel to the end of the incline/decline either that or the trusty old coulored grid system and even different putting difficulty where you don't change anything about the put itself  only the grid and arrows i.e coloured grid on easier difficulty and arrows on medium none on expert.


when you turn the power enhancement down it also effects your accuracy and loft of the ball i have tried many different stances and positions and it just wants to do a driven shot from the tee then hit a bump and shoot off into the rough. crazy i know.


if things like this could be sorted then you might get a higher rating and a better review but until then i'm afraid not.


yours fretfully.

 big plus for this and for any similar ones, hoping more. also, this one is free. anyone with vr system, i think, should get this.

there is very little to do beside walking (=teleporting), and the puzzles are really uneven. the first one is actually pretty hard to figure out as you have no idea what to look for.
i enjoyed the final one with the capacitors but that was about it.

the final sequence (that everyone is raving about) does have a nice 'encounters of the third kind' feeling about it, but the dialog is pretty meaningless and doesn't fit the preceding events. it's plain inexplicable. also, the sequence itself is more of a visual effort than a story or event. it doesn't make much sense.

the game mechanics are generally okay, although there are some glitches (i had to solve the final puzzle with e flare shell stuck to my left hand). voice acting is great (especially the sister on the tapes) and sounds are also spot on.

if you're considering buying it, do so for the ambience and visuals, not a great adventure game. it's more of a taste/showcase of what adventure games will be like in vr.

"like most horror games, to make up for a lack of content this game provides the player with no direction and infuriating puzzles that force you to walk around in circles until you finally try something that works. i've barely gotten very far and haven't returned to it in quite some time. i think the setting is cool and finding the little talismans around is nice and creepy but i don't like how you have to switch between using the camcorder and real life and point it at very specific things just to progress in the story. 
i'm sure this is a lovely homage to the movie (which i have not seen) however i worry that this mechanic makes the game less enjoyable and forces it to ride and sell based on an already established ip as opposed to something that could be incredible; because i can tell this studio has talent and potential. 
if i'm going to be forced to use the camcorder, i'd rather it not be for the sake of progressing the story and instead using it outlast-style wherein i would need to look through the night-vision preview to navigate through dark areas.",1697490792,0,,148356197

"i've been looking for a game that can find the perfect balance between realism and fun. during this journey i found that dcs is far too time consuming to learn, plus it makes my wallet cry ($80 for a plane? i get they're almost the real thing but still...). 

war thunder is the other side of the spectrum, easy to learn, free, and realistic enough for me in air rb. sadly, vr support is horrible and the game itself has a ton of issues that i won't get into here. just to cut it short, i don't have fun in it like i used to years ago. since then i've been looking for the holy grail of flight sims that can achieve this balance.

i can safely say that i have found it.

this game is absolutely the best vr flight sim i have played. it might even be the best regular flight sim i've ever played. it has the balance i have been searching for. 

the systems can be complex, but you don't need to watch 10 hours of youtube tutorials in order to learn how to use it. the flight models are realistic and act like they should. there is also a wide array of weapons, ai enemies, and features for you to mess with.

the game doesn't melt my pc, and runs great given my setup is barely vr ready. (gtx 1650 super, i5-11600k, 16gb ram) not to mention the base game is a little over 3 gb, which is great compared to wt or dcs.

i really enjoy the mod support, as it gives the game limitless potential. for example there are an extra three aircraft as mods online for download, the f-117, f-16, and the a-10. this isn't including all the quality of life mods like one that allows you to play your own music in flight. the devs really seem to care about the game and are constantly updating it (helicopter and multiplayer just dropped? sign me up!). the stock missions are a little lacking, which is my only tangible complaint, but the modding community and steam workshop comes in clutch and produces some great content that i can spend hours beating with each plane.

and the price? $30 usd. totally justified and worth every penny. especially when we have dcs over here offering a single plane for triple the cost and learning curve.

if you're looking for an excellent and fun vr flight sim, you found it. couldn't recommend it enough.",1640839832,4,0,678324

"this is an updated review after 2 weeks ownership.   while i did some tinkering, some googling and sought tech support at immersed's discord community i never got this app running smoothly unfortunately.   while i loved the concept and some of the environments are great - particularly the lodge above the river and the ski lodge one i don't have any particular value in the team stuff - this is a solo home thing for me not a corporate tool.  thus once my elite membership expired after week one the app was basically killed for me as you are left with one single room to sit in.  while the price of a subscription may be reasonable for a company it doesn't make sense for an individual - particularly when vr desktop costs a one time payment equivalent to a single months elite subscription and horizon workrooms doesn't cost anything at all.   the app has a lot of promise though so i'll keep checking in and if they did microtransactions to cover cost of new environments etc i'd be willing to pay.",1652882220,5,"Thanks for the feedback!

"organ quarter is one of those beautifully rare moments for silent hill fans where someone not only understands the essentials and building blocks of surreal and mesmerizing horror, but perhaps not coincidentally also has the skills needed to take that understanding and make it into something original. imagine if scp-610 took over a small urban town overnight and you seem to be the only one out of the loop of societies new economy specializing in skin, that¡¯s what the first hour of organ quarter is. you are a shut in who never leaves the house (for reasons that would be a lot easier to explain than mine to my psychiatrist) who is told by the voice of your doctor on the telephone that it¡¯s time to leave your comfort zone and go smell the roses, only to quickly find out that said roses are made of processed ham and want to eat you. it pulls off the nightmarish breakdown of common logic incredibly well: there¡¯s no intro cutscene or exposition needed, just you, a gun, and several subtle ques pointing you in the direction of what the hell happened to the town and why a lady in a mask very politely, in a perfectly normal tone asks you if she can have your skin when you are inevitably consumed by the very walls of your apartment building. but enough about the content of the game itself, you likely came here to know if the game will scratch the itch that most modernized gaming horror can¡¯t, with its juvenile jumpscares, ample ammunition and/or lack of any artistic balls. and the answer is fuck yes. the fact that sounds, not screeches or the clanking of metal but ordinary ambiance made me dart my head around faster than a woodpecker on crack is assurance enough for me that the games¡¯s atmosphere is top notch. the early 90¡¯s looking indie visuals actually add to the tone very well,  giving me flashbacks to my first playthrough of silent hill 1 and harvester. and anyone who knows me is aware that i don¡¯t get scared by video games outside of the existential eeriness of the narrative, and organ quarter manages to have both that but also one the first times i was ever genuinely afraid to keep going, knowing that the game¡¯s wonderfully dark imagination wasn¡¯t above making something dreadful completely ordinary in it¡¯s own little world. i felt an immense feeling of relief when the credits began to roll, along with an incredible feeling of satisfaction knowing the game i just played would become one of my all time favorites. hell, there were times where i felt genuinely lost on if i was going in the right direction and the game was able steer me to the exit every time without any arrows or objective markers, that¡¯s how good the level design alone is. as a designer, however, the lack of any kind of melee weapon confuses me. running out of ammo will make you wish you had one more bullet to shoot yourself in the head with and go back to your last save since you are now completely defenseless. it only happened twice in my entire 5 hour playthrough but it was especially a kick in the balls for me since i went mostly melee in all the silent hill games and now being forced to just dodge enemies like how i dodge the special needs kid in the school hallway instead of facing them at a disadvantage wasn¡¯t as fun. there was also a moment where i thought the game broke because an elevator door wouldn¡¯t open on a specific floor, when in reality it just didn¡¯t go to that floor and there was only a slight indication. the $25 price also makes me wish it had more replay value, like an infinite ammo mode or an option to make the monsters wear silly costumes, that sort of thing. that being said organ quarter is easily the best game to get for vr if you¡¯re looking for a legitimate survival horror and not a haunted house simulator without the option of punching the poor man in the costume while pretending you¡¯re leon kennedy or something.",1562731312,3,0,597537
"synth riders is my new favorite vr rhythm game, largely because i like the fluid and somewhat dance-like motion it creates -- easy on my body but still gets my heart rate up. with the long ""noodle"" notes, that motion can feel similar to tai chi at times, but grows much faster. because there isn't a directional mechanic to the notes, i find the movement more natural feeling than something like beat saber.

i [i]did[/i] enjoy beat saber first, but after about 50 hours, i tweaked a very specific muscle in my upper back while playing, and 2+ years later, that muscle is still not quite right. maybe i was playing incorrectly somehow, but i think beat saber does put more stress on the body and leaves it more prone to injury. there can be jerky and sometimes awkward movements and postures with that game.

i don't think i've ever re-aggravated my back injury with synth riders. it probably can't [i]quite[/i] reach the level of vigorous exercise i was able to achieve with beat saber, but it's still a great workout for me. i also found the included soundtrack surprisingly impressive in many places, and also preferable. the tracks from perturbator, scandroid, waveshaper, powercyan, etc. are pretty solid.

there are certainly some downsides. the community is small -- nowhere near beat saber size or popularity -- but dedicated. the game seems a bit too forgiving in some scenarios, where i'm registering notes i didn't hit correctly. with alternating red and blue notes in the same position, for example, i can just put both controllers in that spot and all notes will be hit. the stages make me motion sick by default, though thankfully i was able to turn off stage motion effects in the options. i like the 80s synth vibe, personally, but it's not for everyone.

the last thing i'll mention is that there [i]is[/i] an option to enable some sort of ""hitting"" mechanic with the notes, where you shake the controller as your controller crosses through it. i turned this off, for the aforementioned issues i had with similar mechanics, and because it sounded pretty blah.

synth riders is surprisingly good! i highly recommend giving it a shot if you're up for something different and into the artists or genres on the soundtrack.",1696232397,0,,147489307

"simply brilliant!! physics and responsiveness feel very close to the real game. multiplayer works like a dream. i have had some of the most fun times ever on paddle up multiplayer, which leads me to my feature requests to the dev:

 ** can we have a record of the scores in all the games youve played
 ** can we have a simple 'friend' button so we can link with and find people again
** and of course global and regional leaderboards

finally, would love some more environments that are a bit more... gritty? unusual? eg top of the empire state building - in fact, why dont you allow users to upload their own 3d panoramas to use as play spaces? that would be really cool.


in summary, this game is very, very good and simply a must-have for any vive owner - just buy it!

"as someone with no medical training, i think this is a really good sim. the main takeaways for me are that i have no idea how to read ultrasounds, and that low blood pressure/high pulse is terrifying when you have the ekg constantly in the background. 

the controls are smooth and easy to interact with, on the index controllers my only issues were i could not teleport with the right controller, and that selecting medications uses a physical grip instead of a trigger press. on a very high-spec machine, this plays butter smooth with no settings touched. oddly enough, there are physics for the hoses and very little interaction with the dogs themselves, though that may be intentional. (on the table, i have not interacted with any in the lobby.)

i highly recommend this game to anyone who has a passing interest in medical work. i hope to see more practical applications come to ""gaming platforms.""

i assume all the unlabeled medications don't currently serve a purpose in-game, i am not familiar with all of them yet some have their purpose on the container. i assume fentanyl is dosed in micrograms, whatever unit of measurement it uses has a broken symbol. because there are no finger physics and objects are grab/no grab, the dial to adjust anesthesia is hard to turn without hitting the switch.

as a player who is interested in medical but has no experience with animals, the pharmaceuticals and blood tests were easy, but i struggled with reading radiology and ultrasounds. it may help to have a slower introduction for imaging as i have no idea where organs are located on a dog and i still don't. it could be helpful to have anatomy charts inside the game itself, perhaps even a full model.",1695890223,0,,147191592

"played on a acer wmr, vr: vacate the room is a very good escape the room game with some minor gripes.

most of the puzzles are ¡°reasonably¡± logical. the design is made for room scale. this is certainly very immersive, i found myself huddle on the floor looking for clues and peaking around objects. there's reason to reach for the games ceiling, this is a problem. for some people you may not be tall enough, for me i pushed my hand in my ceiling fan while it was running.  no harm, but some thing to consider when playing.

the game is immersive to a fault.  it stick to room scale ¡°realistic¡± style of game play.  there is no teleport to move or joystick support. there is no inventory, everything needs to be physically placed in the room.  as far as i can tell there's no saving to come back later.  so it lacks in convenience but due to the brevity of play time it's honestly not that bad.

overall it's a fun experience, the issues are minor in context.

"the game is great!
smooth controls once you get your vr legs. i love setting movement to high and jumping around & shooting like a pro. aim is always more accurate for me than a mouse so the game is way easier than pc, but like all remastered and vr games, i severely crave online multiplayer play. 

please, please implement multiplayer play? this is the only thing keeping these games from staying classics!!!",1571779902,2,0,753272
"if you always wanted a blacksmithing game in vr this can definitly scratch that itch for you.

smelting your ores to create bars, crafting different sword components and creating handles out of wood all feels really nice.
the way you use blacksmithing books to look up recipes for items works really well.

the blacksmithing might feel a bit grindy, in the first few hours almost everything you make fails, but if you grind some more in the time chamber to level up and gain some skills it will get better, and it will feel very satisfying if you make a perfect sword!

im not able to make bows sadly, for you need to buy bow strings in the store, which bug out every time i buy one and try to put it in my bag.(tried it alot and lost a lot of starting cash)

the movement in this game could use some polish aswell, i am a big fan of first person movement with smooth turning enabled, but in this case turning while standing still doesnt just turn your character in place, but you rotate in a pretty wide circle, which causes you to get stuck in walls tables etc.

the time chamber is more fun than i had anticipated at first, it is definitly a good workout.
i think every level is fully computer generated which sometimes results in 2 targets coming at you at the same time at very different angles making it impossible to hit them both.

there are bow levels scattered inbetween, overall the bows feel really nice to shoot and once you get a feel for it aiming cost no effort at all, however sometimes the bow is a bit buggy  resulting in the bow not firing the arrow when you release the button which in turn will result in a instant loss of your timechamber run.

the biggest downside for me is the mining, i really hoped that i could head out into the mine with a pickaxe over my shoulder to find my own ore and gems, only to find that the mining is a static machine that you will need to feed power crystals to keep generating ore for you.

overall i am happy i bought this game, altough it is very clearly an early acces title, which will hopefully get alot smoother over time.

we live in wonderful times.  times where you can enjoy vr software that takes you places you could not physically go now.  the graphics and controls are very good.  however i have to say that the controls do take some getting used to and can be annoying at first.  i really like the orrery tour and the ability to walk our solar system.  i have had a telescope since i was very young and have always loved planetary astronomy.  this is really what i have always wanted.  the ability to see our solar system and understand it in a new way through this wonderful vr experience.  i will still use my telescope though this does not change or detract from the real thing.,1582428214,5,"Hi Ross.

"not had the gear vr headset for very long, literally a week now, but so far this has been the only game i've found that doesn't just feel like a glorified tech demo. i am noticing a little more stuttering further into the game, but it's still minor and generally the whole experience has been pretty rock solid so far. it's almost hard to believe it's all running off a phone. i haven't finished it yet, so i don't know what the chances of a sequel are, but more games like this would make me very happy indeed. only one suggestion for improvement that i would make would be to maybe have several changeable points of view in each area, as sometimes with only the one perspective enemies can be tricky to target. apart from that i'm excited to get back to the game and seeing how it ends!

update: also, the forward tilt of the game makes it more suitable for playing in a chair that you can lean forward in, which i guess is intended since your character is sitting in a chair looking down at a table, but it does make it a bit of a strain to play when you're lying back. more of an observation than a real gripe with the game.

so far i'm giving it a 9/10! but that could easily go up to a 10 if the story continues to be as good as it is so far.",1500953014,5, ,33696

"review video: https://youtu.be/i-a5mh6ggo8

there¡¯s two game modes, a campaign and a survival. the campaign is a little generic, the story is basically in text form in menus. it doesn¡¯t come through in the gameplay. survival is fun. it gets pretty hectic but not unmanageable.

they have a unique approach to movement. it can feel limiting at first, but it soon becomes a tactical decision on how to move around. keep smooth locomotion turned on.

the art style and design of levels are well done. only three maps but they do feel big and wide open. the cell-shaded art style is done well and feels very polished.

there¡¯s a lot of variety in weapons. you start with 4 base pistols that you can unlock and upgrade and each has a unique special ability. enemies you kill drop their submachine guns, shotguns, etc¡­",1529203916,0,0,701458
"this experience is largely on rails and it feels frustrating. while the visuals are stunning, especially given the performance constraints of the quest, you feel a real lack of agency and this breaks the immersion. it feels like you are in a passenger seat of a theme ride more than anything else, especially during the fight instances with the rancor. largely the experience is about going to different way points where you freeze in place and then take some action. i was also frustrated by how little leeway the experience gave to to experiment and fail. for example, when i was fighting these flying beasties with the force i started messing around to see what i could do. vader cut me off pretty quickly though and just said i was a disappointment.",1575948214,5, ,154090

"this is one of the ""must-have"" vr games. both adventure and sandbox modes are amazing and memorable experiences.

first you are thrown into the alien world of paper beast to explore object interactions and solve simple environmental puzzles in a short campaign. realistic sand/water/wind simulation, great animations and spatial sound make environments and creatures feel real, despite their surrealistic appearance. 

after gathering few entities in a campaign, sandbox mode opens up(but it's better to collect all the entities before trying it out). there you can design your own environments and create self-sustaining biome with a palette of plants, animals, special objects and events. world is quite small but it's very well optimized and allows smooth scaling from human to mountain size perspective. i ended up spending the most time in a created level with mountain throne in the middle, where i can sit and watch the nature below)",1615326813,0,0,391489

"i have a lot of fun playing this game, weather its solo or co-op! 
admittedly it can be a little buggy but that's to be expected with early access.

this game has random gen dungeons with optional difficulty levels, you can choose to have the more combat heavy nightmare dungeons or exploring heavy adventure ones. either way there will always be a mix of enemies, traps and biomes. 

its been really awesome to watch this game expand its got such a great formula which is easy to add too, seeing new mechanics classes, weapons and enemies. my fave part so far is the mini bosses, which can be actually quite intimidating to fight. i will say that the main boss of the game is less so exciting but i'm sure it'll be adjusted in future.

some of the soundtrack is real epic and adds so much, and the atmosphere can really catch you off guard with how eerie it is despite the colourful graphical style.

in the future i would love to see some bigger boss battles with interesting mechanics and also just some all round more content such as room variations and weapons (which there is already quite alot of).

i just started playing bc i bought when it was on sale but first impressions are good.
game mechanics are pretty good overall with my only real complaint being the janky building system.
its pretty fun with games being not too long but not too short.
tutorial was enough to get me started in multiplayer but i found i had to ask teammates how to do some of the smaller things like ping and build while climbing within my first few games. 
when it comes to the overall basis and background of the game it felt very dry.
yes, the map design and gameplay are pretty unique but i think the longer i play the more ill need more content. theres a lot of room for story telling for the game and i think implementation of this would make the game more interesting and engaging. 

end thoughts: really great concept and has a ton of potential but there is still a lot that can be improved. ill give it a pass for the downsides though because compared to a lot of pc battle royales its still pretty new.",1619475508,3,1,687123

probably, no, the best vr game to date. valve was known for always pushing out ahead of their time product. half life 1 was a great first person shooter that was able to convey a story and keep you entertained, half life 2 is still one of my favourite games, and then valve, out of a blue moon, releases this. this masterpiece that is half life: alyx.

i have a vive, and i played through it on the vive. but just because i don't have an index doesn't mean that i didn't experience it. if you can't afford the index, there are many cheaper alternatives on the market. windows mixed reality, oculus rift s. it's all about researching their upsides and downsides, and picking the one that fits your budget.

valve really does know how to make a game. i don't know if they will continue to make vr games, or go back to pc games. only valve knows. but all i can say is this: half life: alyx was amazing. if you are planning on getting vr. you need to play this. hands down",1597502562,0,0,540252

we have tried many vr fps game and so far we always comes back to zero caliber. it is a strong solo campaign with lots of weapon to have fun with. we can add many features to each gun which increases the desire to explore the game even more.
what to expect from this game:
responsive developer team who keep a strong peace of patch or content release.
fun (especially when you need to save a scientist and you interact with him to intercom :d )
cooperation (push your team mate as dead meat before entering a room)
build crazy weapon (beretta with a long sniper scope ahahah)
some challenges in hard mode
a call of duty approach --> no hardcore game, it's more a waves of npc  and no one bullet kill :+1: 
exploration: search in each map (like in the trashbin) to find another exotic weapon skin or a pink uzi ??

i¡¯m playing with the following config:
occulus rift,asus strix 8gig 1070 gtx. 16gbram, i5 2500k oc x42 time.
graphics: it¡¯s more than correct and lots of evolution since we bought the game a while ago. it¡¯s not a triple a mostly because the hardware does not allow it so far. also the map have a good size which means that they need to sacrifice in the detail and other object to bring more credibility¡¯s tot it
gameplay: pretty robust gameplay very responsive with some glitch from time to time but patches are on the way. 
sound: nice voice off, the comments puts you in the move. i would love to have more an action movie from the 90 approach however it goes well. nice weapon sound
storyline: an assumed terrorist attack based on one of our most valuable resource: water. i really love the comments and interaction, could be more reworked on the script but we laugh a lot here and there in the game
what i would love to see coming up:
map & story line generator, fine tuned npc movement, 
an additional point gun that we can carry, at this point in time we are limited to 2 weapons, i would like to have 2 main weapon and a side arm on the chest.
my son is 1m30cm and the height configuration is not fully operational, he cannot run and he is frustrated for that

summary:
if you¡¯re searching for an arcade fps with lots of fun and crazy weapon, the game is definitely worth the price
and keep in mind that the game is still in early access where the dev does a lot to listen to the community and bring new features along the road

"there is not much i can say about this game that hasn't already been said. therefore i will state my opinion on the most important points:

- i've played this game on story mode for almost 8 hours, and still have not completed it for the first time. it's not ""short"" for a vr action game, if you are taking your time to have fun and casually explore each level. 

- there are a few different weapons, and easter eggs and collectibles, but most useful items are far and few. you spend a lot of time tediously opening drawers and cabinets and filtering through useless props, just to maintain a steady supply of weapons or find a trinket you haven't before. it's not 100% necessary, as you can get through most of the game just by sneaking, if you have the patience. 

- occasionally you'll have to find a keycard or piece of information that supports the predictable story, but most things can be found by a ""brute force"" method of just systematically searching everything in sight. the real payoff of exploration is discovering alternate routes and hiding spots that you can use during re-spawns or harder difficulties/game modes. 

- the environmental scale, and action in this game is solid. everything in the level looks and feels the right size. the mechanics work well. the enemy ai feels balanced and developed. i'm not a fan of ""teleport to move"" mechanics, but it is a core gameplay element here, and this game has found a way to integrate it properly. 

- you'll need an area of clear space (at least 6'x6', i estimate) to play this game. it is not a game you can play sitting down, or cramped up against walls, furniture, etc. you actually need to reach, throw, duck, dodge, etc. on your feet. i would not call it a ""casual"" vr experience.  

overall, the game is pretty immersive and makes you want to keep playing - the art direction and mood of the game follows your standard corporate-escapist theme, with a lighthearted satirical tone mixed with ominous vibes - the player walks the line between being hunted, and being the hunter in order to destroy the hand that feeds. in combination with dedicated vr-focused gameplay, it is successful at being a thrilling single-player stealth/action adventure game.

"some players don't like missing features like true room-scale vr or old-school systems that have reportedly already been ""improved"" in other vr games and replaced things like the good old menu-based inventory management, etc.

i disagree. it's skyrim and the menus and inventory management of the game were great just the way they were.

skyrim vr isn't about some ""cool"" gimmicks like throwing virtual ingredients into a modeled cauldron to brew a potion or having fancy animations and 3d-space interactions to do some basic video game stuff. these things get old really fast and ultimately just make the core game-play clunky.

skyrim vr just wants you to have the good old skyrim experience. only you're actually inside of the game world and have full presence. it's the first successful attempt at an incredibly engaging game that you could spend hundreds of hours in and not get tired of. it introduces something cool and new by being in vr but it also doesn't forget that it's still a video game and that no amount of creative shenanigans to improve the realism of your ""immersion"" will change that. at least not with the technology we currently have.

so many vr games during the past few years have tried so hard to make the experience as realistic and immersive as possible that they forgot that at the end of the day, a video game is mostly supposed to be fun. and as one of the most critically acclaimed video games of all time, there is no arguing that skyrim is. and it's now in vr.",1523302600,0,0,609169

"i wish the developers knew how to do multiplayer better. the fact that i'm somewhat bad at the game doesn't help. so sometimes i angle correctly, but then the game throws the ball in the wrong direction because i hit with the wrong direction on the racket. 

however, the reason why i'm giving this a 4 star, is due to the cheaters in the game. especially in the low ranks. i have no doubts about the high ranking players being so good at the time. they litterally practise 24/7. no, what i'm annoyed about is that the cheaters angle the same as me, and hit in the same direction and speed as me, yet they hit their target, dead on! and more to the point, actually, why do i end up in the same game with the same person every time i attempt to find a new person? 5 times in a row, i encounter the same cheater. this game has some serious anti-cheat problems. the fact that they somehow implmented an aimbot for this game scares me. what else can they do, aside from an aimbot? what happens when these low rank cheaters get to higher spots and lose against a pro player? i have stupid feeling this would be a repeat of what vrchat is trying to nail down protection against right now. they could actually pull some senstive data from the target by using rce exploits in the game. or even worse, destroy the opponents vr headset. 

if you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience with friends, sure. go ahead. strangers? hell no. the game is fun, but i would not risk playing public multiplayer with these cheaters. go and look somewhere else if you are into that kind of stuff. otherwise, this game is pretty fun single player. and like everyone has been saying, good workout... if only you can get enough time play this. you can be going for quite a good while. ^^",1580873014,5, ,334584

"the new standard in videogames and the ultimate vr experience, half-life alyx showed us that when a developer truly understand the medium they are working with, they can create an experience that evolves the medium itself.

vr games for many many years has been know as tech demos for the vr technology, showcasing the potential vr can bring to the table, but barely doing anything interesting with said technology, valve managed to develop a game that not only its a main entry on the legendary half-life series, but manages to do it by using every trick the vr technology has to offer, this is not the case of an already exiting videogame getting the vr hands slapped together and done, its a videogame built with vr in mind through and through, from level design to narrative every single ounce in this game has been built with a vr headset in mind, the level of interactity that the vr tech has has been squeeze to their technical limits in this game, this is not /just/ a shooter, or a puzzle, its a fully developed aaa game, it not only pushes vr itself, showing us that vr can be used for more than tech demos or the most recent ""metaverse""  push by meta where is basically vrchat with less steps, this is an experience, it doesn't have gimmicks, it has systems and you will experience how deep this systems go.

i strongly believe this game marks a before and after in the industry of videogames, its a popular rumor that valve won't develop half life 3 because they want their games to be impactful on the industry, from hl1 ai behaviour to hl2 source's physics, well, half-life: alyx sure is impactful, and i cannot wait for what are they cooking up, be it vr exclusive or a more traditional experience i know valve still has the secret sauce.",1674064506,0,,131099531

as a frequent eurocopter/airbus pilot in other sims, what i would most like to see is a more advanced model of helicopter from airbus, such as the h135 or 145, and a larger sandbox, even if those things were extra dlc - i'll certainly bring these things up in the community since the developer clearly listens. but overall this is a nice distraction to quickly do some free flight (or a mission or two) in vr in an easy-to-control robinson clone.",1617422821,2,0,424204

"amazing mod
the movement and implementation of vr into this title that didnt have vr in mind when it was made and so on is all in all pretty great
i only have a very few problems with it: 

one being reloading the combine assault rifle, instead of the reloading just being the core being inserted into the barrel, you replace the entire magazine and no core moves at all, maybe something could be changed about that, maybe instead of replacing the whole mag, just manually replacing the core into the barrel

the reloading for the smg is a bit funky at times, like, the point where the mag inserts into the gun doesnt always work

driving the airboat and the car are terrible experiences. i personally dont suffer from motion sickness, but i feel like anyone who does, will throw up while trying to drive in less than 30 seconds. despite not being affected by motion sickness, i did get a headache from it, probably due to the very fast movement. i understand that the vehicles behave the same way as in the original half life 2, but maybe you could try to implement a cleaner driving mechanic that is much smoother 

that being said, i still think its an awesome mod, allowing one to relive part of their childhood but now in an even more immersive way.

"very good for helping your vr legs grow, i could only use blink movement and turn snap 45o degrees in vr without getting sick. 

after using nl with the option ""arm movements on hip"" for 30 mins i can now do without it for like 45 mins using the vanilla movement controls without getting sick and i feel my vr legs growing steadily, if i feel the sick coming i start using natural locomotion again and it goes away.

i did try without this program to overcome vr sickness moving arms and walking in place and it helped to some extent (i suggest you try that aswell as is free), but adding this program worked for me much better because it ties your movement speed ingame to your physical body movement and i feel that ""reality anchor"" helped me a lot to not get sick.

if you get sick in vr this helped me greatly to overcome it, worth the price, lots of configuration options.

-better troll
while playing through the swamp level i had a problem where getting off the troll at awkward angles would cause me to respawn back at the troll's starting point, which happened 2 or 3 times and the troll was not there so id have to restart my game.

"""buy or pass?""

-> pass

""why pass?""

-> too much comfortability pandering has ruined this games potential. locomotion in this game is a joke at best, and i mean that. it's so slow it seems like a novelty that it exists. a little bit slower than the crawl speed in onward. activating ""free"" locomotion via the joystick is a non-priority option that you have to figure out how to activate on your own, after the lengthy tutorial. like all comfort-pandering vr titles, you spend the first 20 minutes in the settings, enabling locomotion, turning off snap rotation, turning up the rotation speed to max, and disabling any other un-immersive settings that are turned on by default when your first play these types of ""all-inclusive"" titles. in this gem, the primary froms of movement are: selecting a magic ""teleport"" arrow, equipping it to your bow, and then trying to fire it at a position you want to ""move"" to. if your shot is off, you must wait for the arrow to complete its animation, before firing another to try and teleport to where you want to go. your second option is throwing a ""teleport crystal"" with your mainhand. you do this by equipping a teleport crystal, and then tossing it a maximum of about 1 meter, which will teleport you 1 meter in the direction of your toss. this game was meant to be played standing or sitting motionless, aside from your arms. you are meant to take up a position in a level, and then stay there without moving like its a resident evil arcade game at dave&busters. if you have to dodge an attack, you have your 1 meter teleport crystals(lololol). it is not a game that will feel like you're there, fighting monsters, it feels like you're playing xbox on a large tv. this game is honestly better suited for a nintendo wii. always be wary of games that have a comfortability level in the green.

this game, like many cash-grabs in the oculus store, trys to reel in the serious vr gamers, while simultaneously trying to hook the 55 year old single mothers who are so well known for loving virtual reality. but in trying to chase these two rabbits, ""in death: unchained"" falls short of both tasks. i think its good that they're trying to update it, but at this point they're whipping a dead horse, killed by greed.

"[h1] experienced on the oculus rift [/h1]

so there's a lot of negative reviews and they all mention price. when it first came out, this game was $9.99 usd but now it's completely free to play and the dlc soundtrack is $9.99 usd which makes more sense given the content. i personally think the music is really good.

it's also cool that you have different avatar heads to headbang to for the different 5 songs total (plus credits so 6 i guess). however, the visuals are severely lacking. most of them look like low resolution 360 videos you might see on youtube that are labeled as vr. the visuals are that ugly to look at. there are some cool scenes. there's this one with lava rain coming down that is pretty cool, but that's the exception.

on the other hand, the music is head-banging fun. it's free. i think it's a complete no-brainer to download it now. you even get 8 easy achievement to 100% the game. i just wish they had worked on making the vr visuals more exciting. at least the hair physics on the head-banging avatar models is spot on, whoever worked on that is a genius!

"pavlov is a good game if your into counter strike source and want css in vr with a few extra modes inspired by gmod.
the problem with pavlov is its not a sandbox game or really taking advantage of what makes vr good in any other capacity then fps shooter, which is a darn shame since everyone seems to play this game like it is gmod but it just isnt... it markets itself as this cross platform flexible sandbox, and people market it as that as the game tries to dress itself as a open form cross platform multiplayer shooter sandbox. but its basically just css/cod in vr with extra modes with no dedicated sandbox mode which is stiff and inflexible in what you can do with it. if you just played css or gmod you would get the same experience but for less money. gmod even has a vr module and i enjoy that a hell of a lot more then what pavlov be offering up because its more flexible.

and now i am gonna get people asking i could mod it to do a sandbox but you need dedicated server tools to do that by this games convention, problem? the dedicated server tools are linux only not windows so you would have to vm a linux distro just to run a server to mod the game... i see no reason for that kind of complication the dedicated server tools should be windows compatible and there is literally no excuse in that because i have seen many games in unreal that have windows dedicated server tools but this game doesn't have that so what the heck is the hold up there.

they should make server hosting doable in game with mod/crossplay support, or make the dedicated server tools windows compatible.

overall 3/10 - just get css or garry's mod or if your a gun nut hotdogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.
the games feature set doesn't warrant $25 when many other great games have managed to do more with less. i get its cross play with psvr2 so it has that going for that but you and your friend really better like css or cod and maybe the small totally not taken from gmod game modes in vr because that's really all that's here for you despite 7 years of development.

as for me i am refunding it its just not a good game for vr in my eyes for $25 around that price there is a lot more games that do more including in the vr space. and i got in hopes of playing with my friend in vr who uses a psvr2 and something more then a basic fps with a few extra modes especially given the price point.",1717569293,0,,166716278

i also have some gun suggestions for the wwll game mode 

luger po8 was used during that time by officers

the bar or b.a.r was a common machine gun for the allies especially america 

the mg42 would be great because the germans used them a lot

the 1911 was used in wwll by the allies especially america where the gun was made

1903 springfield was used a little by american troops as a attachment you could make the peterson device which turned it into a semi auto .30 gun instead of a bolt action .30-06 rifle

the sten gun would be a cool addition because the british used it a lot for wwll because it was really cheap

i would like some anti tank rifles like the lattiel 39 or the boys anti tank rifle but just a suggestion 

a m30 drilling was a double barrel shotgun but there was a small barrel underneath the two shotgun barrels where a rifle round could be loaded

a shovel melee weapon would be cool because the troops would use them to dig holes in the cold weather to stay decently warm 

some other anti tank rifles could be the ptrs and ptrd both are soviet anti tank rifles

oh can i just give you guys huge compliments for adding the johnson rifle it¡¯s not well known so it surprised me to see it nice job

oh the kar98k¡¯s bayonet is correct but it would replace the slot of the cleaning rod and not hover below it????

i would like to see machine guns kinda scattered around to use i think it would be cool

otherwise i love this game to death and have so much fun i hope you will take my advice into consideration",1649619420,5, ,194116

i like this utlity and i belive it is worth the purchase price.

i'm mostly interested in this product for the mouse look gaming.
that is, uising the vive as a method to look around within a game not designed for vr. mouse movement emulation.

tested and works very well using the fpv (mouse movement emulation):
skyrim se (disable enb) **3d
fallout 4 (disable enb)
no man's sky **performance (studdering)
space engineers **3d
empyrion glactic survival (very minor studdering)

marginal (while these do not do well with headtracking, they do run nicely in the main window):
kerbal space program **performance (unplayable signifiant lag, at least in iva)
fsx-no head tracking (entire screen moves)
rising world (everything works, cursor is lost on crafting stations)

does not work with:
conan exiles - drm? (i suspect you would get the same results with emb or any injector).
ark -drm?
7d2d - crashes vr toolbox and i think steam vr (does not run at all, window, fullscreen, fpv)

**performance
i made no special allowances for performance. i ran the games at the settings i would normally run them full aa everything on (unless noted above). i have a gtx1080 but an old amd phenom ii 965. overall the performance of this product is very good. in most cases equal to or better than competing products that provide similar functionality (i have 4, a couple at higher price points).

**3d
usining reshade and blueskynight's superdepth3d you can setup sbs 3d. this will not work in the first person head tracking mode but a 3d window pulled up close is very nice. performace is great. 

did not try all games with the superdepth3d injectors. if noted they work, if not noted, they might.

in skyrim the 3d giant hand problem remains but that has nothing to do with vr toolbox.

general notes: most game uis use the edge of the screen, with headtracking enabled you may not see all ui elements unless. a key to auto zoom out would be nice.

much of the manipulation of the windows (moving a window or changing it's size) is accomplished with the vive controlers. while it does work, it's uncomfortable from a seated position.

"i can't remember what i paid for this on sale, but it was a relative pittance and a much more appropriate price than the full normal $15 price. pricing aside, i loved it! it's short and sweet vr bullet hell, an almost direct xortex 20xx clone mechanically but with different and expanded content. took me about 40 minutes, would probably take others significantly longer, but still best played through in one session. it's difficult but forgiving, with checkpoints at the start of each relatively short wave (i think around 20-30 waves overall?).

there were two waves which accounted for a majority of my deaths - the final boss (which is appropriately over-the-top difficult), and one earlier wave around the middle of the game where you are uniquely attacked from all around, not a problem itself (in fact something i'd have liked more of), but during which i kept dying mysteriously to what i eventually figured out was direct contact with the small transparent 'ghosts' left behind by killed enemies, as they moved around through the central area. i doubt this was intentional.

first, the main protagonist is speaking. this is already nonsense for a supposedly immersive fps game, but doing this in vr whole new level of stupidity. and ""i"" am not just speaking sometimes, ""i"" never shut up, preventing me from reading things, understanding where i am, and figuring out out what to do by myself.

i tried to stick with it, hoping the endless verbal diarrhea would stop after the first hour, but after seeing the comments, i know it won't.

devs: you are making a game, not a film, not a book. got a story? the player should experience it through gameplay. if you want to tell a story without engaging the player, make a damn film. if you want to narrate without showing or involving the player, write a book.

"i love this game 100%, cannot recommend it less. as of writing this i have currently put approximately 42 hours into this game. i very easily spent about 20 hours working with this game to mod it into a playable state. take fallout 4, drop the resolution to about 480p, make it run worse, and then rip out the ability to play dlcs and all qol changes since release. that's about what you can expect base here. 

however if you are willing to work with the game to improve it's quality you can absolutely find the best vr experience currently available. (i would like to emphasize however, this is unacceptable from bethesda, shitting out low-quality content for its' community to fix has been the name of the game since fo3. this is likely what culminated into fo76) 

games like minecraft and ksp were extremely easy to work with and mod, basically drag and drop the mods into the games folder. for fallout 4 vr, even with a mod loader i had to; download multiple mods and learn to establish an extremely sensitive mod load order, learn how to, and then proceed to, re-write several .ini files, write a new script extender and toggle it to always activate on start-up.

prior to this game i only had the most basic of coding experience with making text adventure games with friends, so this was an extremely long and painful process. but i do believe it was worth it, as this might be the most fun i have ever had with a video game. however without all the work i had done with this game it would be damn near unplayable. it does still crash about once every 6 hours on average even with me increasing its performance with additional mods.

"in congress, july 4, 1776

the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america, when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.--that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.--such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

he has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

he has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

he has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

he has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

he has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.

he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.

he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:

for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

for protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:

for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:

for imposing taxes on us without our consent:

for depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:

for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences

for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:

for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:

for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

he has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.

he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.",1665196452,0,,123514198

a few things i think would make the game better include: 
-not having to read every scroll every session to find out what they are since many of them are harmful
-the bow is cumbersome to use, especially given how well some other games implement bows. i think a hand crossbow would be thematically appropriate and mechanically more consistent with how the bow is used in this game.  
-the melee sword simply passes through creatures, which is counterintuitive. it would be great if it provided a little knockback of the target and vibrated the controller to provide a tactile sensation with each hit.",1489024469,3,0,454176

"seeing the trailers and youtube streamers immediately noticed the pin physics are not there, but everything else looked so well polished. 
however after playing it today i'm pleasantly surprised how unforgiving the ball release is. no auto-correction like in premium bowling. 
like in real life if i dont release properly it will not go straight (when throwing beginner style straight without curve). it forces me to focus well during the release like in real life which makes this much more interesting experience. i've read the other reviews throwing down the gutter, it's user error and not the game's fault. if i dont focus properly i get the same  premium bowling lacks in this area. 

two notes for the developers, the pin physics do require improvement as it doesnt look like they interact and fall realistically. however when i expected a split i did get it, so it just needs some tweaking. also noticed that i had 2 pins drop and removed when machine went cleaning the pins and could not get spare because they were still counted as standing after 2nd throw. did happen in real life too though so maybe its programmed to make mistakes :-).",1622172214,5,"Thanks for the review! Hit us up at support@forevrgames.com and we'd love to hear what about the pin action doesn't feel right so we can continue to tune it. It's a physics simulation where it mimics reality as much as possible. We went by regulation size, weight, and material properties by US bowling standards and thought we got them as close to real as we could. Even the SFX are procedural generated by physics! :-) Those pins drop once in a blue moon because... well.. physics! Anywho, thanks for the note and hope to hear from you in support!

"i bought this game yesterday, after debating between this and premium bowling. glad i got this! physics are good and the graphics look nice. i haven't done the multiplayer mode yet, so i will just edit the review later when i have played it.

pros:
-great graphics
-pin physics are realistic
-lots of customization, including balls with different stats, maps, and oil patterns
-progression (xp system to unlock more balls, which are bought with coins in the shop, maps, and oil patterns)
-the 90s map has licensed music, but can get repetitive with the few songs that play.
-uses the new oculus avatars

cons:
-ball throwing is a little odd, i bowl a lot irl and do decent, but here a lot of my throws are gutter balls. (there is an update coming that changes this though)

overall, this is an amazing vr bowling game. there are lots of cool updates on the way, and i can't wait for them to come out. very glad i chose this over premium bowling.",1623036214,5,Hi Gabe8273!  Thank you for the kinds words.  Team ForeVR,278351

there is a community wiki that is basic at best. i went to the website nothing there just some feature lists and basic sales information. on steam there is a link to github docs which barely has anything also.

playing around with it i figured out some things. the software has a lot of features, and i can tell it took a long time to build and there is a lot you can do. i think it would be good to hire a ui/ux person because it would be lightyears better. 

i'm not able to record and fight against my recording like in some promo videos, which a tutorial would help with. i can record but then it exports to fbx via blender it looks like instead of just fbx with the animations encoded but when i try to export it says blender is not found.

i joined the discord and search for this issue and few others seem to have it also. it was talking about environment variables and so on. so, i set that up but still didn't work after resetting and trying some other ideas. i also see others in the discord asking about a tutorial too. 

i wouldn't have bought this if i could've tried to export in demo. the demo doesn't allow you to export. i bought it and waited a month before trying the real version, which is my own fault. so, i will have to hope this software improves in the future and get proper documentation and tutorials. 

i also think the demo should allow for at least 2 exports just set a variable then cut it off, it will save a lot of headaches to those wanting to try it out.",1708875207,0,,159252405

"by far one of the best game on vr to date. definitely going to set the new standard of ""quality"" for the platform. hoping the success of this game paves way for more titles of this caliber!

graphics: by far one of the best on vr.

gameplay: 
- extremely interactive and really fun
- as expected, guns require you to reload physically and also force you to be cautious of reloading when not fully expending your clip. dont waste bullets!
- the gravity gloves are a nice touch bringing a common vr feature into the world of half-life while still seamlessly integrating it into the lore.

immersion: 
- game is by far the closest in graphical realism ive experienced in a long while, ive been playing vr for a few years now and this is the first game in a long time to make me flinch forgetting it isnt real. 
- walking is a bit slow
- no smooth turn option breaks immersion for me at least (hoping its a feature that unlocks later)
- no jumping option. they chose to use the teleport mechanic instead which for me also breaks immersion.
- the interactive environments along with all the ambient sounds makes it feel more alive and real.
- character animations are fluid and feel genuine making them feel more realistic.

audio:
- great! (minus the bug mentioned below). the sound effects of feel impactful as voice acting is superb. 

ui:
- minimalist is key and they hit it right on the head. nothing crowding your view, and the weapon/tool switch ui is very intuitive and efficient. 

bugs: some yea.
- unless everyone else was short, im slightly too tall in the game.
- some graphical issues like glitchiness/stuttering
- audio can get weird as you turn causing the sound to switch which ear its being played through abruptly",1584990791,0,0,562927
"half-life: alyx is a very immersive vr game that draws you in from the very beginning.
i've only just played 4 hours of the game but i want to continue the journey to see where it leads me.
having played all the half-life games before, this one is valve as its best.
i half expected to bump into gordon freeman.
if you like vr games then this is a must have for your vr game collection.

"i would give this game a 5/10, i should have known better since it was made originally for meta store. there are many graphic limitations and an empty world.

many bugs that i have found: 
lost sound, gender change on cinematics, bugged locks, voice changes, main story blocks where you have to restart the game.

the skill tree is okay but only 1 power is interesting from there, the story is slow and tedious. it is good at imitating dishonored's blinks but there is a lot of missing potential.

the enemies are 2 main types and then you also have boss fights but they lack any emotion.",1714061459,0,,163567807

"tl;dr i friggen looove this game, constantly comin back to it and having a blast while playing it, althought im sure i look absolutely goofy as hell cuz for some reason i like to throw myself sideways across the map vs the forward run motion:) i dont think its necessary at all to enjoy this game but i am also a huge fan of climbey, these are probably my 2 favorite vr experiences. i bring it up because climbey was one of my 1st purchases and i would dream of having a couple machine guns to gun my buddies down while climbin and bouncing all over the place, and i think this is as close as we are gonna get!


this was initially going to be my response to gamecookers question in the community hub bout the last update and if the game is any fun, and halfway through i realized i was basically giving my review of the game so i cut and paste it over here. sorry for the crappy formatting i never think to do these but with vr it seems more important to fill the community in with lots a crappola out there! so glad they came out w the demo because after getting burned by so many tech demos and wave shooters i wanted to buy this but the 2 things holding me back were the game seemed dead (november) and i didnt understand if it was really a bit like climbey locomotion with guns, even tho some of the youtube vids looked like that. and honestly this has become right up there w my absolute favorite vr games to come  back to. the best way to describe it would be like a more action packed onward with less downtime, throw in a little counterstrike (buying loadout) and a bit of climbey type locomation, climbing around the level with guns and it just doesnt get any better! also due to christmas and the demo release the game seems to be growing more and more by the day and i definitely dont see the momentum going down anytime soon... this is getting updated by the week, and not pointless crappy updates. very core gameplay tweaks the community wants coupled with the occasional surprise like a new maps or when necessary bug fixes/game balancing. with this last update the devs even threw in a basketball court and ball to mess around with in between the match for people who joined the server ha.",1484131695,3,1,520150
"i really didn't have high expectations after seeing the trailer, but thought i'd give it a chance. mainly, i was curious to see how they'd deal with the challenges of the medium and see if there were any interesting workarounds.

the way they handle the camera made me feel sick and while i understand why they use it in different ways (one moment the camera is your head, the other it's static in the scene and you watch yourself), the inconsistency of that approach makes for a really jarring experience. here's an educated guess: action movies with lots of motion and sudden movement are not the best fit for vr! 

to be frank, the whole movie gives the impression of a filmmaker hearing about this cool new vr technology and giving it a try without consulting anyone who has experience with vr. furthermore, while i get the experimental nature of the experience, realize that probably wasn't the focus of the project and assume the budget was low, the writing is consistently abysmally cringeworthy, and not in the ""so bad it's good"" fun way.

i haven't watched the bonus material yet, maybe there's some interesting tidbits there. i tried watching one bit, but it had no sound.

all in all, i wanna be supportive of people experimenting with a new medium, which is why i bought it, but aside from the historical noteworthiness of this vr experience, it's hard to find anything redeeming about it. sorry to be so harsh.",1543029814,5, ,340028

"good first impression, but bugs are riddling the game.

proximity voice chat isn't a thing, and even then our voices are muterd by the game for some reason when we radio chat. it'd work for a while, and then it'd stop working.

the third campaign missions seems glitched at the objective requiring you to download data, and the campaign in general puts kill barriers up and boundaries making it impossible to proceed with a partner if they fail to catch up, and forced to either restart, or continue at the expense of your friend. also it restricts more freeroam with the climb mechanic making it feel a bit redundant to have it if we're not allowed to explore. boundaries are okay when they are game breaking, but don't restrict actual ideas of manuevering.

the hand animations are kind of bad as well, like my hand wont hold the magazines properly so i have to come in at an angle to load it,  it's not easy to two hand pistols, and you're better off just one handing it entirely, the ai bugs out almost all the time.

but overall the core gameplay is fun. the content is rather short at the moment, but i know early access can be that way, and i know they will polish it.

now for more quality of life stuff. for some reason on the vive, i just cant figure out how to remove attachments. occulus, can but i can't seem to figure out how myself. ranks feel absolutely pointless as you only unlock stuff by completing missions, not by ranking up. i feel like that was a misopportunity to make playing the game feel rewarding, even if you aren't playing new missions. also, continuing to next level at the end of missions, forces anyone with you to quit, so that's a little annoying.

obviously this review is full of complaints, but that's because while i'm having a good experience, these things are whats keeping me from having a great experience. i'd say wait until full release or until it's more polished before trying the game.",1541811420,2,0,736312

"tl;dr: this game is pretty much a masterpiece and is easily worth the $30. this game essentially has infinite replayability and it has no competition. i don't have any complaints about this game.

this is probably the best video game that i've ever played. this game easily surpasses half life alyx in both complexity and replayability. the full-body physics is truly impressive and is leagues ahead of any other game that has even ""attempted"" it, like blade & sorcery (only your hands have collisions in that game). although i haven't had any issues with the physics you probably have read other reviews that say that this game is janky and broken. that is because of one simple factor that the reviewers don't mention, they're simply just bad at the game. people don't think to lift their legs when they're climbing or to pick up heavy items with two hands. heck, people put in their height incorrectly and still get mad at the game even though it's their fault (pro-tip: if your height is correct, all of the enemy's eyes should be at your eye level. that also means that if you are like 7 feet tall or like 2 feet tall you will still have the same experience as everyone else.) if you are picking this game up, i highly recommend that you watch an advanced boneworks movement tutorial and in like 5 minutes, you will be parkouring around the maps and super-jumping all over the place. in the end, i have no complaints at all about this game and i can easily recommend it to anyone.",1592500543,0,0,717233

"i really wanted to like this game.
i was willing to overlook all the shortcuts (cop out on big head stylized graphics, no arms or legs, lag causing spells to pass through enemies, the wonky spell detection system, etc..)
but what killed it for me was the intentional decision to jack the difficulty up at level 6 in a very half-assed way.

notice before you buy. you cannot make it to the max level (20) solo. its not doable.
not even with 2 people. you need a group. and you need to grind on high level mobs. that is the only way to keep your character level high enough to continue the main quest line.

for some reason grind on mobs your level gives almost no exp. it would take 10 something hours of grinding to go from level 6 to 7.

also of note, there is no push to talk system. you mic is always on. and so is everyone elses.

as for the crowd of people who are going to jump up and down screaming that the spell detection system is skill based, i would just like to ask them to cast the knockback spell. somehow everyone can cast the level 2 fire spell without any issues, but the level 1 knockback? extremely difficult. and if you somehow manage to get your success of that spell above 50% then by all means, try the level 2 knockback. go ahead. i'll wait.",1517930592,3,1,696479

"as a starwars fan it was really cool. that being said there are definitely pros and cons to this and the other 2 ""episodes"" as the call them.

pros:
   the graphics are really good, story isn't bad either. it does give you helpful prompts on how to play if you get stuck.

cons: 
    some say it's cheap to buy at 10 bucks but to get the whole experience it'll cost you 30. for this you get less than an hour of play time in combat scenarios. couple that with you never die so there is no incentive to try to do your best on the way thru the game. 

it was entertaining though very short,  it should have been just 25 or 30 bucks and all 3 together. if it also had some type of incentive to try harder to not die would make it more of a goal type game that would prolong the play time to finish instead of just giving the end to you . definitely geared towards millennials, gen y's and z's.",1611458614,5, ,153539

"first criteria of getting the game should probably be if you like the music. there is not much (or any) genre variation, so take a listen to some tracks to see if it suits you. i think the music is okay but would have enjoyed some more variation even just staying inside the electronic dance music genres.

i feel like the basic mechanics get in the way of making this a good rhythm or exercise game. several aspects make the game harder to learn and enjoy.
- animations on appearing blocks makes you waste your focus till they settle on their actual direction. 
- blocks appear in front of other blocks, obscuring the direction in which you have to hit them. 

this makes memorization more important than it has to be, and there is no way to tweak these aspects of the game to fix this. 

the criteria for a good cut are finicky and have little feedback for improvement, only communicated by small numbers away from the play area. you need good cuts to reach the scores required to win some campaign levels.

there is no customization for controller vibration. can not turn it off even. it vibrates on every hit, when your sabers touch each other and when you saber touches a wall. the latter two are distracting, would have preferred if you only get vibration on a good cut for example? or a clear difference between bad and good cuts.

the oculus rift cv1 is also less than ideal for this game. the headset cable can get in the way of your left hand. i also have a hard time of holding the controllers comfortably. either you get an awkward grip where you do not rest your fingers on the triggers or when you do, you feel like you are going to push the triggers swinging your hands around. with a looser grip, the springiness of the triggers right inside of where you rest your hand makes you feel you are going to drop the controllers. this is less of a deal in games where you don't have to swing the controllers intensely, but beat saber requires a lot of quick movement.

i will spend some more time on this game trying to get a comfortable controller grip and playing outside of campaign mode, but i can't recommend this game as it is specifically for rift cv1 owners. 

edit: all of the above is forgivable, but level 11 of the campaign is not.",1587850030,2,0,631576

"**overdue update:**

as of writing this, i have to say that my opinion of this game has changed. the developer has released several updates polishing existing content, and adding more. the game has also been updated quite consistently, and definitely appears to be on track to improve even further. additionally, i have to apologize for my lack of understanding as to what the purpose of this game is. it is as it advertises, a home run derby, and contains even more fun goodies beyond that. so overall, my negative views of this game have made a complete 180. if you're looking to take a trip to the batting cages and whack some balls around, i absolutely recommend this as your go-to.

------------------------------------------


let me start by saying that i don't enjoy giving negative feedback on vr experiences this early in the industry's lifespan. i think most content has redeeming qualities, and anything made well in vr is good for vr. home run derby is a well put together game. there's no motion sickness, and everything it claims to do works. 

that having been said, i personally cannot recommend this title to the average user. it is essentially batting practice, and as such there are minimal mechanics. balls are launched to you at set intervals, and you hit them. you can change the ball size, and background. but that's about it. there does not seem to be a goal or a challenge beyond just hitting as many balls as far as you can. it grows stale quickly, and i would not be able to justify its price for its experience. the visuals are also very unpleasant, and the audio effects are grating. 

if you like baseball and enjoy going to actual batting cages, then this will be a good game for you. if you're just looking for a sports game to spend a lot of time in, then it likely won't be. as a free title, it's worth a download. for the nearly $10 asking price, i'd definitely pass.",1460028446,0,0,480277

"making an immersion vr escape game should be an easy task, which allows room for further detail of making the environment pleasing and the experience immersive. they did not take the time to accomplish that.

the narration is poorly acted, it's like this was done by college students in their freshman year of theatre. the environment design is sub par, you know where you are but you know it's fake. it's not immersive to see the picture of a monitor floating off the laptop. the design is like someone learned how to use unity and made this in a week. 

the puzzles are way too easy, there is no challenge to them. it's just back and forth between getting a code and putting it in. the real challenge of that is to not get nauseous doing so.

i do think this could be a good game concept, but whoever thinks this is the final product is horribly mistaken. it's clunky, it's poorly developed, and the narration makes you cringe.",1483154614,5, ,57140

"fallout 4 vr is for those who love and i mean love fallout. so me being a obsessive nerd of course bought a vive purely so i could try it. after you set up your vive so you feel like you are in the screen, it is a great game, me being a noob to the vive i havent used the touch movement controls much. that being said i prefer the teleport, but the touch controls dont make me too sick to not use them. i do hope they add the dlc at somepoint, i think its just a matter of when in my opinion, becuase fixing automortron will be a pain. but when dlc does come i expect two things, the community to complain they werent there at launch, and to play it much more. far harbor is the best part of the game stylisticly speaking so when it comes i see a flood of vive sales. you can already play farharbor in vr its pretty simple to install from fallout 4. so to wrap up this reveiw unless automotron is your favorite dlc it is worth it. on sale for 30% or less. that way you wont be so disapointed. it may not be as pretty as skyrim, but it is a lot cooler. i mean comeon who hasnt wanted to see what its like to fight a deathclaw in real life (its terrifying). so please if you are going to buy this game, at least get to diamond city and explore a little, before you go screaming about how its bad becuase it is nothing new and that it's ""a lazy port"" the game wasnt made for vr originally. it is still very fun and worth trying. 8/10 would scream from having a ghoul sneak up on me again.",1537283251,0,0,601545

"true to the series, this title has immaculate graphics, excellent puzzles with amzing detail and a plot that, while not particularly deep, is still engaging and moves the game along nicely. if you are a fan of the room, this is a must-play, and if you aren't familiar but like puzzlers, this is an amazing game and you won't miss anything but a few nods to previous installments. 

this is a very low vr sickness game. it is, however, throughoughly creepy (no real jump scares, but some pretty graphic scenes of decay and human remains) so if you can't handle that, this is not for you. if you can, this is a fabulous title and my pick for vr goty 2020.",1609703878,0,0,383002

"i¡¯ve played this game since it¡¯s first days and, to be honest, it has the greatest community i¡¯ve ever seen, i have seen only one or two toxic kids for all the years i¡¯ve been playing this game.
yes, the multiplayer shooting range is chaos with free for all kids battle, but i was playing coop most of the time and everybody there is friendly (i mean i was 11 when i bought it), in the first lobby i joined every single person was teaching me how to play the game.

i have some suggestions: a burst or full-auto pistol(2 points), shield for coop, reloading for underbarrel grenade launchers and mag options like extended or drum ones. speed loader for shotgun so you put 3-5 rounds in at a time, a small smg as a sidearm for marksmen like mp7 or scorpion, uzi so you have chances in close combat,maybe civilians as players some of which are hostile to volk or marsoc sides or just neutral",1653922800,5, ,225260
"as a long time user of geiss and milkdrop back in the day, i have been waiting for the next level visualizer for vr.  i think i have now found it. okay, i don't gel with all the patterns, but i think you are onto something with this app.  i have just sat and litened to pink floyd's the wall with the music cranked up. i chose the zen visi and i have to say that the clouds fitted the floyd superbly.  i would go so far to say that this is my favourite music visualizer to date. the clouds and responsiveness in zen fitted perfectly.  a few of the others i found to be very good are swarm, aztec, and pulse.  please keep improving this app and the responsiveness to go with the more chillout music (i'm old) some visualizations came across as not subtle enough to pick out gentler rhythm's. but were only detecting loud thump thump tracks.  as i say, keep going with this and please try to make it respond more to the gentle beats too.   you will make money by adding more packs.  zen with floyd was fantastic.  more of this please.. very heartily recommended .",1529983414,5,"Hi, thanks for the review.

"this game gets my thumbs up, but it's not a ""big up""  

if you read my review for ""space pirate trainer"" this game is almost the same thing... but not as well done.  actually, there's way more game modes so i guess there's more potential here.  it could use some more polish for sure. 

basically, you're put on a floating platform in a ""space"" kind of environment surrounded by a series of blue portals (not like the ones from the game portal though).  each of these portals can spawn enemies and also provide a way for enemies to exit the area.  once again you've got two guns with different firing modes, but no shield this time. 

each gun has only two modes... a precision laser and a plasma firing pistol.  the gun sights are big and thus easier to see to aim as well. the difference here between this game and spt is that you have a finite amount of ammo and you have to aim downward to reload (like the old arcade light gun games).   spt handled this by giving your weapons a ""battery"" that slowly recharged as you stopped firing so you never had to stop and reload.  reloading takes the focus off the action, though to be fair, waiting for a slow recharge is worse (when your weapon is down to zero charge).

anyway, it's still fun, but it feels more like target practice than defending a point.

things i liked about this game: 
[list]
 [*] it's like the light gun games of the late 80's and 90's.
 [*] the gun sights are actually worth using in this game (i guess they're bigger and that helps)
 [*] there's powerups that do stuff like add bonus points and slows time down
 [*] game modes include survival mode, time attack, practice and attack mode (where they actually shoot back)
[/list]

things i didn't really like:
[list]
 [*] music wasn't memorable
 [*] i'm not a fan of having to reload, especially when one gun only gets 10 shots and the other gets 30.  
 [*] this game has more going on behind you than spt did, so you may find yourself twisted up in the cable as you turn around and around.
 [*] for the most part, the action was a lot slower in this game so it took a lot longer to build up to excitement.
[/list]

in conclusion:  essentially this is one level. again i get it is free, but come on, a game this amazing, give us more, make us pay for it. i would pay $20 easy for a 4 level featurette of this magnificence, the scare factor is real, the creatures are indeed monstrous, the story, despite there being literally none, is actually more existent than most rpgs current day.  do i recommend playing a free vr title in an otherwise pretty vacant world of titles?  i'd be insane, not to. is it amazing and worth every cent you pay for it, yes in fact it is.  does it make you wish it was an actual game that was playable? yes, and for that, i'm certainly glad, at least the core of this game, is free.",1630964379,3,7,400761

"having fun and loads of laughs in rick and morty: virtual rick-ality a vr game from owlchemy labs for htc vive and oculus rift. we started out with a simple task, doing rick's laundry. however, that task is not so simple thanks to the crazy nature of rick & morty. we were soon wrapped up in a complex plot dreamed up by rick and we, the morty clones, are caught stuck in the middle saving the world from the confines of morty's garage. with a little luck, brain power, and a plumbus we may just succeed. wubalubadubdub! lol! this game is made for fans of the show. it has plenty to enjoy for people who haven't seen the show. i can recomend this game because it's fun and i'm a fan. $30 is a little steep scince i beat the game in 2 hours however there are lots of easter eggs and inside jokes. check out some of what the game has to offer in my video below.

"let me start this review off by saying that if you have friends to play this with the game is 100% worth it. however if you are coming into this hoping to meet some people, play the solo experience seriously, or play for more than a few hours without friends i wouldn¡¯t recommend the game in its current state.

the issues that i faced were with these mini-games:

-ninja biscuits was very difficult because of the throwing mechanic being based on the speed your hand is moving at the moment of letting go. because of this it made throwing with accuracy a lot more difficult. and it was also inconsistent since sometimes your hand would grab the centre of the disc making it near impossible to throw. overall a pretty difficult gold to get.

-bug crunch was just really difficult to get gold on since your hands are often not steady enough to guarantee that you don¡¯t push the bug instead of crunching it. it would be nice if the hit box was a bit more generous but it¡¯s doable as it is.

-totem moles had a weird bug about twice where the moles would just get pushed by your claws and lose gravity.

-cactus kebabs had strange throwing mechanics as well but the main point of difficulty was grabbing the javelins in the first place. the hit boxes for grabbing items already isn¡¯t very generous though so that¡¯s universal with all mini games that require you to pick something up.

-sea saw in multiplayer was a bit weird with hitting the urchins sometimes. in solo though this mode was an absolute nightmare. the requirement for getting gold is unbelievably harsh for how difficult it is. i¡¯ve spent just over an hour worth of attempts on it and have yet to get gold since it also seems to be rng if you get good enough urchin placements to actually have a chance for it.

-rattle snacks is in a similar position to sea saw, an already hard mode with a harsh gold requirement and rng making it near impossible to win certain runs. with the weird grabbing hit boxes to ready an arrow it just puts the nail in the coffin. also a gold i have yet to get after many, many attempts.


so like i said above if you¡¯re looking for a party game to play with your friends then this is totally worth it, the flaws that mainly plague a solo player wouldn¡¯t really be as big of a deal. until they add maybe a computer to go against to help with lack of player population in multiplayer and/or some balance changes to make some modes more doable i¡¯d wait on it for a bit.",1665504000,5,"Thank you for your comprehensive feedback!

"you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/biiy3ulc9v4

[h1]experienced on the oculus rift with touch controllers[/h1]

this game is so lacking in content, it feels like a demo. the dev calls it a sandbox game where you swing around an urban jungle in a procedurally generated city. where there are no objectives or missions and no hand-holding tutorials and ""what you do is up to you."" i think the dev forgot to mention how there is also no game here. 

it's really a one-trick pony game. unfortunately, that one-trick isn't very good. unless you're a 9 year old kid and can get entertained by watching the same tv show over and over all day, every day for a year .. then this game will probably not appeal to you for longer than 10 minutes. 

the graphics are subpar and so are the sounds. the grappling mechanic feels clunky. there are intermittent frame rate drops. and after you've brought down a copter, swung around the city once, and found a star ... there is really no reason to ever play this game again. you'll do all that & more in 15 minute tops.

so i got this game in a vr bundle for about .50 cents usd and i don't feel cheated. however, if i had paid $4.99 usd, i would probably be very upset and asking for a refund.

"people are spam disliking this because there saying that this game is stuff like ""too hard"" has ""too much recycled content"" along with other nit-picky stuff, and here's my take on it-
- (game to hard) this game is made for people experienced with vr (not made for new players)
- (game is not direct enough) this is kinda the main point of the game, and if you don't believe me look at boneworks. that game's main focus is that you can do things your way.
- (game re-uses a lot of assets) bonelab uses the same engine as boneworks and though there the same, bonelabs is more polished than boneworks (to an extent, the game just came out so there are obviously gonna be bug fixes because stress level zero is a well respected game developer that listens to fans)
- (game doesn't have much content) considering how only 20% of people who owns the game (as of typing) haven't even gone and played the game (according to the achievements) i wouldn't be surprised if you guys were expecting another boneworks when the entire point of the game is basically just boneworks but gmod (also there is more content and a story mode maybe if you played the game (?????????????????))

"combat troops is one i've owned for a while now, but only very recently came back to. it's not perfect by any means, but honestly? it's hard to complain with the price tag. also the fact that it's still in early access has me hopeful for it's eventual full release.

i'll start with some things i don't like. the laser pointer ui is really not great. i don't mind it for changing settings in menus, but during gameplay it feels unnatural to point a beam of light to pick things up. in other vr games force grabbing feels way more natural, and i think this is the area that needs the most refinement.

another small gripe is the settings menu. i didn't realize that in order to turn on haptics you had to go to the main headquarters and use the wall menu there. i'd rather a universal menu that allows me to access all settings at all times, even during the initial tutorial. also i feel like controller haptics should be enabled by default, but maybe there's reasoning behind it not being? either way you can turn on haptic feedback. just need to use the correct settings menu.

that said the settings menu leads me to one of the major positives about this game. there are a lot of tweaks that the user can do, but my favorite by far is the ability to enable and crank up perceived item weight. i wish every vr game had options for this as i'm someone who loves simulated weapon weight/inertia, but i know many who hate it. allowing the player to disable/enable and change the strength of it is phenomenal and the dev deserves a round of applause for it!

inventory is done in a really novel albeit a bit strange way. you can carry two primary on left and right shoulder slots, and two small secondary in front (also some vest equipment slots), but then the backpack is just a logo that floats in front of you to the left. i think i'd prefer if the backpack was tied to a shoulder instead at the sacrifice of a second primary slot. if for no other reason than to de-clutter player view. the bag itself is fun to use though. you stick your hand in the top and turn the controller to select which item you want to pull out via a radial menu. i will say i'd like if it had defined clicks into place when hovered over an item. just to prevent over scrolling to the wrong item. still a really cool way of doing storage!

combat (hey it's in the name of the game!) in combat troops is what i'd call more arcade fun. zero caliber/crossfire sierra squad are probably the two most similar vr games to it on the market. it's not gonna revolutionize the vr shooter genre, but it's fun, weapons are punchy, and reloading is satisfying. though there is a weird quirk where you can stick a rifle mag into the grip of the gun rather than the actual mag well. think it may be confusing the two handed weapons grips for pistol grips. i do get a bit of a chuckle every time i do it on accident so it's more of a funny bug. not game breaking.

i'm gonna lump sound design and visuals in together because i want to keep it 100% with y'all. this game feels like the definition of asset flip. like i think they've got a decently solid foundation in terms of game feel, but at times visually and audio wise it's chaotic. voice lines feel like a random amalgamation. explosions will make you think your headphones are about to blow up. i appreciate that it does feel like a loud battle, but it's just not cohesive. same for the visuals. it's a mishmash of random camo, armor, vehicles, etc. on occasion everything comes together to look kinda decent, but this is definitely a game you play for the gameplay. i'd describe the overall mood as... if there was a g.i. joe vr game made in the 90's. which if that's what the devs were going for they nailed it.

i've yet to see everything the game has to offer, so i'm not sure what the full scope of it really is. so far i've been going in, blowing things up, shooting the bad guys, and having fun. for around 10 bucks i think it's worth giving a shot. it's the type of game where i'm like ""i really wish they had a bigger budget"" because they honestly are doing a lot of cool things with the game that much more expensive vr titles don't even bother with. combat troops is far too ambitious for it's own good. i'd love to see it get a nice polish pass before it finishes development, but i'm not disappointed with it! hope the devs stay in the vr space and continue to improve their craft. there's clearly a lot of passion going into this even if it is quite rough around the edges. i hope more people decide to give it a chance and provide their feedback to the devs! this could become a vr hidden gem, but only time will tell.",1731039988,0,,178598946

the devs have tried their hardest to knock the modding community down, but they should be taking on some of those modders to make some of those improvements to the game official because they are great.

but i really hope the devs are continuing to work on more courses. it would be entirely fair to make these optional in app purchases if need be, but let?? hope they do it as i can?? get enough of this game!

minor improvements could be better haptic feedback with the putter, perhaps it could also detect when you make contact with the environment. better avatars. better sound/music options generally. and ability to reset the lost balls so you do it again with other players.

fun
very eary to learn (good for showing friends/family who are new to vr)
doesn't take itself too seriously
relatively short time between ""rounds"" (3-5 minutes it feels like) which is a big plus for me. i usually have people over to try out vr or play with me and having a relatively short cut off point helps give to rotate people out.

cons:
could use more depth.
there is a (as far as i know unfixed) bug where you will occasionally spawn in a bad position. to elaborate: you will spawn on the edge of the boundaries of your play area, but the game will require you to reach over that threshold to play, if your boundary is a couch this isn't an issue but if it's a wall or a tv this will be a problem.",1483578555,0,0,564606

i saw some people talking about poor voice acting and translations but i found like two grammatical mistakes and they were just the text that shows when you're loading into game - nothing serious. as for the voice acting, i am genuinely confused. the voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic. they've clearly hired professionals with great audio quality and a really interesting script. maybe it was an old update i have no idea but the voice acting in this game is on par with aaa titles.",1625251499,3,0,364572

terrible. i see why it's 75% off. controls are horrible (even has you moving around when you're not pressing anything). can't grip onto objects, they just float an inch or two from your hand. there are no clear objective markers. got to the point that something happened to the station and some robot voice telling me to steer the ship from something but there's nothing to actually steer (going to the control arm does nothing as the hand doesn't grab onto the control stickread more, but moving your right hand around moves it left or right, still does nothing). you can't get back to your initial seat to use the joystick that is there. all the other rooms you can't get into aside from the bed section. eventually i ended up clipping out of the station and into space because the controls and camera are absolutely horrible. don't waste your money on this. didn't get motion sick though. some ppl are weak ",1495249200,1,,8

immersion doesn't exist as you have no limbs. vive controllers replace your hands with no weapon equipped. player cannot interact with the environment or items in any meaningful way. just point at an object, click track pad, item in inventory. the whole point of vr is to bring the player into that reality. bethesda created a 360 video interface that just happens to be vr hmd compatible. 

smooth motion isn't optimized and screen is very blurry. beta patch released drops even more frames and does not include file to change settings listed in their post. with the amount of time they had to prepare for the release i expected a higher degree of polish.

the story approach is short, yes, but again i took it as a teaser, not a statement. it tells me a lot about what these developers are capable of and i know if they took it further into something bigger, they'd do an excellent job as it's quite impressive. whether they will or not (as such a thing is a big undertaking) is unknown, but i really hope they do. a fully fledged blade runner epic of this class would be spectacular.",1551151414,5, ,338993

"this game has everything going for it.

beautiful graphics, average performance, awesome audio stories, great voice acting. (sadly no subtitles)

the 1hr playtime steam shows is weird bc according to me, it took me 40min and ~35min for the 2nd one, so pretty short

i can forget about the length of a game if the quality was good, and at first it looked like it would be, but sadly, ""mechanically"" tarzan vr is... pretty bad.

while locomotion and snap turning work fine... everything else feels like a chore, fighting was as simple as you can get, you could wiggle the control and get hits, or just do a hammering motion on top of them and dont let them get up.

climbing was horrible, like one of the worst climbings ive had the unpleasure to use, there is one obligatory story part climbing section (with awesome over audio of one of the original radio shows) and it was awful, clunky, slow, unsafe, and very uninspired.

swinging was... ok? but weird, you dont grab the vines, you magically pull them towards you from a distance, it takes a bit to get a hang of (once you can measure more or less accurately guess when youll be in pull distance), but once you do you its fine. 

but this really takes a lot away from what i expected it would work, there are 2 ~cool swinging parts, but there are a bunch of very annoying ones, like the vines are pretty far away, and at first you dont even consider them, but turns out its the way to go. (i honestly thought i had found a hidden secret area one time and turns out it was just the way i needed to go to continue the story)

bad climbing and weird uninspired swinging, absolutely not what i expected from a tarzan game.

the gorilla encounters stop the flow of the game, you encounter them and they go ""hurry go get jane... bla bla bla"" and keep talking, and you dont want to miss the voice acting, but arent you in a hurry? they dont follow you and talk, you have to stop and listen what they have to say right there, at a certain point i just ignored them, and thats a shame.

also, and while at the start of the game they say they will fight with me, and they always just run away... thinking about it, for being king of the jungle i never got any help from any animals, there was a lion (that looked like it was starving), but i think he just kinda pondered stuff or something, crappy 2nd in line for jungle king honestly.

all around the levels felt very linear and a wasted opportunity.

there where no parts i thought ""hope to do that again!"" but a bunch of ""ugh i hope i dont have to get through that crap another time""

i can not recommend this game because it felt annoying to play, and way too short.",1624752850,3,0,384145

"liked
- great job with physics and explaining it all.
- handles fast hits well.
- a table tennis game!!!

disliked / suggestions
- serving is unnatural, using the same controller. please use the second controller to throw instead, and discard use of grip button - it's not easy to use. (resolved in update 12/07/16)
- sound of the ball makes it feel like a golf ball.
- yellow line at eye level in the background is a distraction and is a similar color to the ball. please change the line color. (resolved in update 12/07/16)
- pressing grip button to receive every serve is uncomfortable.  either automatically serve with a visual clue or use another button that is easier to use like the trigger. (resolved in update 12/07/16)
- feels like i'm playing in an empty swimming pool (intended?). (addressed in update 12/07/16)

it took me a while just to leave the starting balcony i was so entranced bu the scenery. only game that comes close to the detail imo is lone echo and seeking dawn.

the amount of items you can interact with is staggering. if you think you can move it, lift it, throw it, you probably can! gameplay is smotth, enemies are..well, not easy but not hard either. which, if you are more into a story than just shooting whatever moves, you'll be fine. i'm guessing there will be harder stuff ahead.

regarding accesibility, the game can be played sitting down but you'll need to turn around and sometimes reach out objects. you also need both controllers to go through it, and at some point you need to swing your arms to fly (which you obviously can't do with just one hand) but i found out that you can trigger the movement by getting the wings pointing down together (or maybe it's just a matter of time).

theres a nice ambience to the sunset with this app. try 15 minute day and see how it relaxes you. perhaps the title should be changed to tiny island relax or something for those who dont get it ! i like the transition to night insects but the sound loop is teally too short. this app is tye first of its kind in that itvreally does a good job of simulating sunset colors and ambience in 'real' time. some ambient music sound loops would also be good. id really encourage the dev to continue improving this app..its going to be an important genre in vr.,1471663414,5, ,31775
"pretty decent version of thief: the dark project in vr. most of the core systems are there and working properly.  i got a little over 2 hours out of it, which normally i would be asking for a refund for, but since i'm a huge fan of thief, i'll hold out hope the developer can push this into being a much longer experience. if you're not a hardcore fan of thief, then i'd give this one a pass for now, however it is the only not-spooky-jumpscare-ghost-stealth game in vr, so it might be a welcome change to a lot of people.

the stealth works, the climbing mechanic works (haven't found much reason to use it in the current 3 levels though), and the bow is great to shoot due to it's super-flat trajectory for the arrows (i'd probably make the arrows drop a little earlier since the maps are tiny). the dragging corpses into shadows mechanic works well. i was pleased to see that after i had slaughtered 4 guards in the middle of the prison, on my way back, 3 or 4 more guards were actively searching for the culprit. one weak point is that if i do get caught (can't outrun guards), i can often kill the attacking guard by flailing my dagger around.

only downsides currently are that there are only 3 levels (2 dungeon types and a village), and they're all pretty short, the environments do the job but are very empty of details, and while the character models look good, the faces are pretty weak, especially the hair and facial hair. i can over look crappy character models, if the rest of the game works though, which it does.

i know the developer is actively engaged with answering questions at least, so i'm sure they're reading all these reviews.

with that, i'll say that if this game gets a level editor, even a barebones bethesda-style snap-crap-together level editor, it will probably last about 100x longer and bring great success. people are still playing thief (myself included) because it still has people mapping for it. don't forget that!",1605477528,3,0,694286

tbh chef and car mechanic were boring for me. it was just the same things over and over again.

update: this game is so much fun, just don¡¯t play it like premium bowling. the more i play this the better it gets. slight learning curve, but i am enjoying this game more than premium bowling. great party game with amazing gameplay. 


this is not a realistic bowling experience like premium bowling, but it is an arcade bowling experience that will take some time to get use to. i do like all the different balls to unlock and the strategy involved to know which ball is best to use for a given situation. i like premium bowling, but it lacks the polish this game already has. i only played a few rounds, but i can¡¯t wait to go back and level up. worth a look- did not play multiplayer, but i am sure that will be fun ( i need to practice more before my first online match).",1622431414,5,Hi Toddgabweg!

like a boxer on a speed bag, he pounded by dangling cherries raw with a flurry of punches. unfortunately for me i had gone commando for the venture, my pain worsened further due to the fact i was only wearing loose tracksuits. i felt my bollocks bounce around between my legs like an f1 driver taking turns at breakneck speeds. tears rose in my eyes as i could only stand there and take on the assault to my crown jewels, my plums, my cock n balls.

"i've played all three titles in this series. if you like puzzle games, you'll like any of the i expect you to die vr titles. this is the first one where i had to go online to get a clue on how to proceed. and i don't think it was my problem. i'll try not to give away any spoilers, but the puzzle that stumped me was the underwater mission. to complete this mission, you need a device hidden underneath a vending machine. you don't know that going in. for the most part, all of these games are pretty good at giving you clues. this particular mission, however, had a clue they tried to disguise. all i'll say is green means go and red means no go. additionally, a lot of effort went into giving the player coins to be used in the vending machine. logically, you would think you needed the coins to solve this puzzle. however, the coins have no use whatsoever, except maybe to get an ice cream bar, but you only need one coin for that.

as with the other titles, the player can't move from a sitting position. you grab items using telekinesis. the whole idea behind this series is that you must solve anywhere from five to seven puzzles to complete a mission. you never solve all of the puzzles before you die. so, like in the tom cruise movie edge of tomorrow, where he learns from every death, you learn how to avoid dying with each playthrough. anytime you get to a point where there is a time limit to solve a particular puzzle, especially if it is a very short time, the answer is usually a simple one.

as others have mentioned, you'll run into issues with the voice recognition. it was annoying but (silver lining) it forces you to practice your responses a few times and you get to learn what people say when they can't understand you (something no other app taught me.)

In fact the game has a lot of content, have you find all the hidden weapons? There are weapons that unlock when you finish a certain amount of bars. Did you visit all the bars? Currently we have the Modern Bar, Country Bar, Rooftop, Back Alley and the Black Friday.
By the way, have you tried the magic drinks? There are drinks in the game that can give some different status for you... high recommend it! Just don't drink to much or you can barf :P
There is also accessories and different skins for you characters, as well the multiplayer mode of the game.

"not worth the price. janky movement that causes a lot of frustration with these ""parkour"" levels [spoiler] level 11 [/spoiler], hands/feet getting stuck on everything, and a short, disappointing, and uninteresting campaign mode.

the first several levels are just a tutorial followed by having to do 6 minigames to get to the main story, you can simply enter and leave the minigames to progress, but the extremely long loading screens make it just as frustrating. never had loading screens this long, even in hla, b&s, bw, etc., just to load essentially a handful of objects; [spoiler] like after you collect the final avatar, there was a much too long loading screen for a 30 second convo with big jimmy, followed by another loading screen [/spoiler]

if you don't count the avatar levels as story, which they really aren't, and if those and the prologue were cut out, there would be around 1-2 hours of actual story in which nothing is really learned or experienced compared to boneworks. i realized my disappointment when i had reached level 8 and thought ""i'm already halfway through the game"".

this game is essentially just a framework for modders but, unlike with say b&s, you aren't buying to support the devs so they can add more content, slz seems to have the intention of modders doing that for them for free.

"i think this is now the best single player vr game. i think this game sets the bar for what a vr game should aim for.

the main thing that has stuck out to me is how much spectacle is in the game. every chapter is super memorable and has lots of crazy moments. i think this game benefits from its whacky setting which allows for quite a lot of variety between chapters which create real stand out moments. i think a lot of other games have played have more grounded settings which is fine, but in vr i kind of want to experience crazy surreal settings  and show me things i couldn't even imagine.

other great things: depth of story and interesting characters surprised me, great guns with really cool upgrades, bosses are a big highlight, voice acting great, music is amazing.

only negative for me is that whilst most things in the game look really nice (lighting and effects), quite a lot of the environment textures lack detail, but this maybe because a lot of the levels are quite large. also the animation for brian is quite wooden and awkward looking. but i'm really nitpicking here...",1683594667,0,,138025976

climbing is a nightmare, if you don't get your jelly-like arms stuck on something and randomly fall you'll go blind instead as it tries to force your head through climbable objects making it impossible to see what you're doing.

and as other negative reviews have stated checkpoints are a big issue with this game, there aren't enough of them and the few that currently exist cant really be called checkpoints as you don't load back in to a saved state, instead you respawn and run back to everything you dropped meaning its possible to lose items completely, at this stage i found it easier to just start the level again from scratch..",1577317675,2,0,721382

eleven lacks the charm and the tournament of vr ping pong, but beats it in almost every other department.

very realisitc physics: it's not one to one, smashing doesn't seem to accelerate the ball half as fast as real life, and spins are not 100% but it's all pretty darn close.

graphics: very nice looking, but most importantly smooth! full hand and face animations from the ai add a lot to the realism and strategy. it really feels like i am playing against a human.

there is work to be done though. the game has everythng in place for a aaa style table tennis game, it just lacks content (which seems to me to be the easy part). e.g. a tournament mode, and a couple of different looking ai player faces, so it feels like you're playing against different opponents and it could be a top fully fleshed game.

"so, i got this game, honestly, yes, to work out and it does that great. but the reason i use a video game to workout is because i want to win and know the drive to win will force me to keep trying. 

which almost works great in this game except for a huge glaring problem. if you get knocked down at any point in the game, it's rng whether you get back up or not. there's no mechanic for you to help your character stand back up.

why does this matter?  today i fought my way up the ranks (how i do it) and get to the duke, a notorious 1 hit knock down guy. which, again, is fine. however, when you fight him and pin him against the ropes and force him to keep his guard up as you chip him down and finally drop him in the late second, then again at the start of the third; the last thing you expect is to be hit with a random body shot the character threw off a lean, and get knocked out with zero chance of recovery.  what the hell?

if you're going to have 1 hit ko mechanics and fighters, it would be intelligent to add a mechanic where we can get back and not just leave it to rng.

just imagine how amazing it would be to engage in spidey sense slow-mo hand to hand combat, then take off to swing to your next objective?

perhaps your cop chatter radio picks up a car chase, so you swing on towards it to find an erratic speeding vehicle tearing through manhattan. each aim of your controller counts as you time your swings to pickup momentum, then gracefully you land on the roof of the evading car.
again, spidey-sense kicks in as you dodge oncoming bullets from the driver and passengers, before you finally attach a web to one building, and another to the car. the two objects slow down, you're pulling it to a halt.

"i torrented and played an early cracked version of this game and it was so much fun i recently bought it as i want to support the makers, saitento is a quality product and one of the better vr games on steam. i clocked about 15 hours on the cracked alpha version and that was a very barebones version compared to what the game is now.

i am happy to give the developer my money as this is great vr game and has lots of hours of fun unlike a lot of games that are just an hour or two long. saitrento has at least 10-15 hours gameplay time i can see it getting more and maybe even multiplayer one mode day.

in the 6 months or so since i've played it the developer(s) have taken this game a long way. the interface is better, the graphics are better and overall game play has much more content and just feels so much more complete. this is worth every penny and one of the best vr games out on the market. other vr games generally feature repetitive game play or short play times sairento does not.

sairento is effectively a wave based first person shooter but it's not as simple as standing and shooting things there are actual levels to move around in rather than siting in a circle waiting for enemies to come. there are various types of enemies and four mission difficulty settings which effect rewards but offer players of different skill levels a challenge. 

the game has a nice levelling and custom character load out system letting you choose many weapon types and character upgrades such as speed, health, jumping ability, ammo poll, energy and more. the weapons are as you expect melee, pistols, shotguns, sub machine guns and assault rifles. having a sword in one hand a sub machine gun in the other slashing and shooting enemies is a lot of fun.

there are two other categories of weapons i've not yet unlocked which looked like magical powers or super hero powers of some sort. sairento features different types of scenarios such as clear an area, wave defence or stay alive as long as possible. level design is nice and cool too and the graphics are good even on the lower settings. optimization is decent it runs very well on my 1080 and amd 8350 combo so i've been able to run 8x aa and maxz settings... i'm sure it'll be just as good on older nvidia 9 series cards and the amd r9 3 and 4 series gpus.

some players may get a little motion sickness as there is a lot of moving around, spinning around and wall jumping to get to enemies and to avoid taking damage and gun fire. i only have a small play area so occasionally knock into my book case. i don't think it would be as fun seated so standing/room scale vr is a must to get full enjoyment out of it. some may get bored quickly of the same three scenarios but the weapons and difficulty settings give me enough enjoyment.

think the matrix meets japanese anime cyber shooter and you have sairento's style to a tee. what this has over a lot of other vr shooters and wave games is there's so much more going on than pointing and shooting things. the harder difficulties require strategy, ammo management, sensible load out usage and good use of the bullet time ability. you will literally look like a crazy action hero whilst wearing your vr headset.

the only bad point or bug i've found is occasionally the pointer to select options on the main menu doesn't load after a mission and i have to quickly hit the vr options button my vive controller and then close the menu to fix it.",1497194108,3,0,574930
"pavlov never needed in game coins and stuffs.  frankly, the new update feels like the devs are trying to milk this game for its last few drops.  every 'new' map seems to be some sort of old popular mod or some sort of beta that was scrapped, but dug out to get hype.  i've been trying to pass up the seemingly low player count by my menu settings, although it really does seem to be shrinking fast.  i'm starting to recognize players between my month long hiatuses, and the more i keep coming back i see fewer and fewer people.  some of them i really hope have good lives outside of the game, they seem to play just about every day.

great game while it lasted, but it's a mockery of what it use to be.  only way i can see myself coming back is if there's some sort of free customization thing that isn't just holiday or special event skins, like what if i just wanna paint my guns pink with lipstick marks?  maybe a silvered look, or something else that isn't a pre-made skin that i gotta pay real money for.  don't wanna lose my shit at the devs this time around, cause this update really just says ""here, customization, are you happy?"" in a tone of an unenthusiastic fast food worker.

if you're looking for a lively game, with great matches and good test of skill, this ain't it anymore.  it'll get its boom in players for maybe a week or two after this update, although after that it'll be back to the usual.",1689711198,0,,142352219

"i don't really like the game, but it doesn't mean that it's bad

this central game mode is a series of arenas wherein you fight progressively harder combinations of enemies that get equipped with better gear. you earn gold to upgrade your own amour, buy potions, shields, weapons and the like. 

this in itself isn't bad. i actually like that there's a progression system of sorts, unlike blade & sorcery's (shortened to b&s from hereon) purely sandbox method. however, the physics interactions were pretty lacklustre for me. it's only after playing this b&s and boneworks that i realize how important sophisticated physics are for me when it comes to vr. 

there are canned animations for enemies dying and reacting to being hit, the weapon handling feels strange and restrictive, and interacting with your inventory is clunky. you can pick enemies up and have some neat interactions with them (i.e. ripping off heads), however this game's lesser focus on player physicality and freedom means you can't necessarily do things you'd think you can such as manipulating enemy corpses or dropped weapons. 

some parts that are actually superior to b&s would be enemy movement and the general faster pace of combat. enemies dodge roll, and rapidly fire arrows at you while maintaining their distance. it makes for equally or sometimes more hectic fights than in b&s. also it goes without saying that the gore system is visually pretty nice, though the physicality isn't quite there -- heads explode but they feel more like balloons popping than a skull being crushed.

there is quite a bit of strategy involved in the combat itself, as dealing with enemy armour and skeletons vs zombies makes certain weapons more effective than others. however, the clunky controls and lacking physics make the combat generally less enjoyable for me.

i assume, however, that the lesser physics are a result of optimization efforts as the game handles multiple enemies on screen much better than b&s does, whereas that game constantly runs at 40 fps when fighting 5 enemies with simplistic physics turned on. graphics wise, both games are on par, with b&s having more diverse locales and hellsplit having a more defined artstyle.

overall, this game does succeed in what it sets out to do, which is create a replayable arena game with a lot of weapon variety and flashy visuals/sword fighting. though personally, i enjoy the physicality and emphasis on freedom of movement seen in b&s.",1685245493,0,,139130664

most of the fun of this game comes from its hardcore survival experience, and it is easily broken by various common problems with your vr control. if you are just a bit slow doing all sorts of work in the environment, like lighting a fire, picking up something you badly need in the mess of your backpack, collecting animal parts from all over the place just because they popped too far from your cut--man, it's gonna get frustrating.

the current vr platform is just not built for anything that requires delicate handling.

"about 2 hours in now, and a decent chunk through the first dungeon now. i'm enjoying what i've played so far (though the spiders... really slowed me down... and i don't have issues with spiders in other games.) decided to try an archer, as the last couple of melee-focused games hadn't felt good enough for me, so bow was a safe bet. you can still get melee weapons as an archer (and ranged as a warrior) so you won't be solely one or the other.

ranged combat feels good, and you'll have a lot of practice moving backwards to keep ranged enemies at bay. i do find myself switching to melee combat. i haven't had the issue from the other review of enemies blocking everything, though they do block about half my attacks if i just wail on them. though i also find it helpful to supplement damage by quickly switching to my ranged weapon and hitting them with a shot before quickly switching to my melee. enemies don't strike you at weird angles, so you won't have to block ankle shots like some games seem to go for.

the graphics are quite solid. enemies have strong, defined features, so i think they're great to look at. games that put a lot of features on a face have them look a bit blurry if you look at them from a distance. enemies don't blend in with the dark environment (in a good way), so you have clear, defined targets.

you have an inventory you can manage with both hands on your belt area, and i think it's a great way to do an inventory system. it's hard at first to tell that the slots in the middle are different than the ones on the left and right. not sure if it was just me, but i had a hard time initially, even with the tutorial page there, figuring out how to equip my weapon, since the weapon slots looked the same as the inventory slots. i thought the one on the tutorial for weapons was the quick item slot, so it just took me a bit. i don't know if a difference of color or a symbol or something would help, or if i was just blanking.

melee weapons felt pretty satisfying to me. they have that weighted feel (at least for my dual daggers setup) to them. when you hit them together, the controller vibrates, and a spark kicks, so all the right effects are there. same for banging them against the wall. i'm sure the bigger weapons won't have as strong a feel, but those ones at least feel satisfying to play with.

my only real gripe so far (aside from the spiders) is the amount of exposition from the first person you meet. it felt like it dragged on way too long. i eventually began skipping it. right after it equips you and gets you set up it sits you down for what felt like 10 minutes of solid talking. i wouldn't have minded the longer dialogue after i've had a chance to get in there and try out my new weapons.

looking forward to seeing the final product.",1552372369,0,0,599041

"being 40 odd and not thin, i imagined such athletically challenging games such as tennis were way out of my ability to not be terrible at. 

first person tennis has done nothing to change this.  however, it showed me i was terrible in a ridiculously superb way.

let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.  the graphics are not going to wow and amaze you.  they're functional, and clear, and right now, that's really all that matters.  i would be very pleased if the developers would spruce up the visuals, maybe a few more human models would be good - it's a lil creepy to look around the court and see line umpire and crowd clones...

the game itself is put simply, tennis.  playing in vr is an absolute must.  arcade mode is fun for those who have difficulty doing anything involving hand-eye coordination - you just swing in the general direction of the ball, and the computer will try and figure out where, if you were wawrinka, the ball should land.  you still have to put some effort in, like roughly aiming, and varying swing speed a bit... but on the whole, you'll feel like nadal on a good day when you start figuring out how to swing the racket and actually hit the ball.

simulation is clearly the more challenging version.  it is still a touch forgiving - the game apparently assumes you have murray's arm muscles as you can hit that ball at ridiculous speeds if you put lots of effort into it - which is a bit unrealistic. (i would like to see a calibration option to perhaps judge how fast you swing compared to a pro player, in order to connect you to the ball a little better).  however, once you get the general idea of correct swing speed, the feel of hitting the ball and it going in roughly where you were aiming is most impressive.  as i mentioned, i'm clearly terrible at tennis, and while i attribute it to my skills and spacial awareness, it did feel occaasionally like i missed what i thought was a hit.  still, that is very likely a skill and not a game issue.

one thing i will complain about is the lack of hand/arm.  inexplicably, your free hand is shown onscreen, but your racket hand isn't.  now, this is a little disconcerting, and i would very much like to see a hand there, just to reassure my brain that i am indeed holding a racket and not controlling it with just the power of thought.  and i think i would like to see my arm and a body too - it doesn't need to be a 1:1 copy (please), but i think it might help with positioning while stretching to meet a just-out-of-reach ball.

movement is done exceptionally well, with 3 options - teleport, which simply moves you to a position you can hit the ball, sliding, which literally slides you to the right position - more natural in terms of moving, but could cuase some people to be motion sick possibly. the third is like teleport, but allowing you to swing your arms in front of you to move to the net (the other 2 options you click the thumbstick if you want to approach the net) - i've not tried this one yet and it sounds a little odd.

finally serving.  this is probably the most difficult and frustrating part of the game - in simulation mode anyway (arcade is much easier).  now, the devs did something i highly appreciate, given i only have a partially working left hand.  to toss the ball, you can simply do just that, holding the grip button on the left controller, and letting go at the top of the toss.  the ball will faithfully follow the parabola you set, and you swing your racket to hit it at the right time - and hope your aim is good.

i can't do this, because my arm doesn't really do what i tell it.  so the devs have added a one-handed operation, which i am most impressed with.  simply by holding the racket hand grip button, a ball will appear, move your hand up and release will send the ball directly up at a fixed speed, allowing you to concentrate on actually hitting it.  it's a great addition, and very thoughtful for those like me, or just those who are useless at throwing things straight!.

limitations? vr is always going to have a few issues, and as usual, the viewport is going to be a pain.  because headsets have a limited fov, you can't really use your peripheral vision to track the position of your racket or ball to make an accurate shot.  serving is also difficult as you don't really see the racket just before you strike - and this makes aiming a bit more difficult.  i imagine with plenty of practice, you can probably compensate for this, but i would keep it in mind as it will likely frustrate for a while.

this game is crying out for multiplayer.

overall, i think i'm going to have a hell of a lot of fun with this.  it will absolutely improve fitness, there's no question there.  the more room you have to play the better, as when in slide mode, it doesn't mean you're always in the perfect position to hit.. you need to move a little bit too, and this is a good thing - assuming you don't have a wall in the way.

"it's my 2nd day in vr and this game is absolutely what i needed in my life.

1/11 updated:
alright, having beaten the campaign, watched every mini-documentary and played a good amount of multiplayer i feel now i'm qualified to tell you why this game is worth a try.

let's get obvious out of the way: mini-documentaries are awesome. let me tell you something that will prove it to you. my wife doesn't play games. let alone, shooters. i was watching those mini-documentaries sitting on my couch with my screen being reprojected onto the monitor. she noticed that and got interested. she sat beside me, i doubled the sound on the computer's speakers and we started watching. we happen to watch the one about french resistance, the longest one. it seemed like it lasted for good 30 minutes, and my wife cried in the end. and they have 6 or 7 of those documentaries in this game. granted, some of them are really short, but all of them are so different, they talk about different people from different perspectives. these documentaries are really really captivating.

now let's talk about the game itself.

gameplay.
i've seen some people say that the vr-component of the gameplay is too basic. for example, you reload the shotgun automatically by pressing a button, as opposed to being able to do it by hand. or the fact that if you let go of your weapon it automatically holsters. i agree that some things, like the shotgun reload are too simple, but i completely disagree that automatic holstering is a cons. playing on the index controllers i cannot tell you how many times i dropped a gun or a magazine mid-reload in pavlov. the nature of the index controllers assumed that you have to hold your grip at all times, which sometimes is not natural, especially in a fast-paced shooter. the fact that i could just let go of my gun to pick up a grenade or something make the gameplay so much smoother for me. 
let's talk about gunplay real quick. the gunplay in this game is completely different form pavlov. mainly, it's more aracadey. you don't have to control the recoil - instead each gun has a predefined spread radius. so you just spray and pray essentially. depending on your preferences, it might be a good or a bad thing for you. i honestly don't mind this kind of system. it's more of a cs vs cod kind of thing. every game has it's fan-base.

campaign.
the campaign consists of 6 missions, each of them is broken up into several sub-missions with load screens in between. the main things that immediately stand out - it's action packed, meaning that you will shoot a lot of enemies and move from cover to cover all the time, but it also has a lot of talk and cut-scenes where you just stand there while npcs awkwardly look you in the eye for an abnormally long period of time. the missions themselves are interesting, the story-line is captivating, although i'll be honest with you, story-line is the last thing i care about in shooters. each mission has 3 types of collectibles which you can find here and there on the maps. btw, you can listen to every vinyl-plate collectible you've found in the main menu (just turn around and you'll see a vinyl player and your plates). overall, i found the length of the campaign to be more than acceptable and moderately interesting.

graphics and map design.
ok, i cannot emphasize this enough how i love when games have different environments. from snowy mountains, to cities, from trains to military bases - this game just nails this aspect. 10/10. that train map though was my favorite, closely followed by norway. highly recommend!
now, speaking of assets, i find that a lot of them were reused, which is expected given the scale of this game. you can basically find the same kind of books and bottles on every map. on the other hand, there are a lot of unique assets too. i was pleasantly surprised to find a full eniac computer on one of the levels! or full-scale tanks and rockets, boats and trucks. and so on.
in terms of graphics overall, this is not hl: alyx, but it is on par with other vr shooters. no problems there.

multiplayer.
ok, even though i had a lot of fun in multiplayer, i felt like this whole gamemode was somewhat a placeholder. first of all, there are not a lot of real players there. and for every spot on the map every lack of real player is replaced by a bot. i guess this is more of a small player base kind of player since vr is not ubiquitous. however, there's another problem that shows that mp is a placeholder: lack of progress. when you start a mp game, you get all your guns available to you right away. there are no ranks. there are no power-ups or upgrades. there are bazookas and grenades scattered around the map for you to pick up, but that's about it. i was hoping to see more of a call of duty style progression system, this this game is essentially a cod in vr. but sadly, i can see how mp can become repetitive very quickly.

now, should you buy this game? yes, absolutely. is it worth 60$? hmm. i'm kind of on the fence here. if this game didn't have those extra-materials like documentaries, then probably not. 40$ sounds more fair. but given those documentaries, are they worth extra 20$? i believe they are. besides, what other game in vr offers you a cod-like experience in wwii?",1609455610,3,0,405146

"lets start with the good: 
1. story telling is ????
2. animations are ????
4. voice acting is ????
5. loghtsaber dojo is cool in vader immortal: episode iii. has some content thats unavailable in the story line
3. lightsabers
4. spaceships
5. darth vader
bonus point: basic combat(only a pro for people just getting into vr gaming or gaming in general)
6. always works properly
7. ok graphics
8. incredibly well done haptics. something that most vr games lack.


now with the bad:
1. i had a hard time writing the good things about the game
2. way too short
3. poor interactivity with surroundings
4. ""were gonna teleport you here to make you watch a cutscene and you won't be able to move""
5. laughable final scene combat animations. like bruh, it was cool and all and then im seeing ""this""??
6. its basically all cutscenes. if you enjoy 360 vr movies its fine then. gameplay could've really been miles better and the story could've been longer. let us have some sort if jedi: fallen order type game, cmon. valve pulled aaa with hl: alyx, and so can you. again: poor gameplay because theres little of it and its super basic
7. costs way too much for this kind of experience. if you're looking for an actual game and you have a gaming pc - better get something for oculus link(unless you really want lightsaber dojo)
8. unbelievably bad audio positioning. it's just stereo. you could've at leeeeast used hrtf for 3d sound. this impacts immersion a lot


conclusion: if you want some good quality basic stuff for newbies - go ahead and youll most likely enjoy the experience. this game is not rich with gameplay.",1670954160,5, ,190837

"if you play the game i implore you to try three characters: bard, ranger, and runemage. these characters are intricate and have a lot of depth in that physical practice and decision making in each fight will significantly affect your performance in a battle and the attacks are very mechanically intricate. the other 5 characters are overly simplistic where there are usually only a couple slow combos you spam throughout the entire game. while reborn added a lot of things, the map before reborn had much more satisfying progression and a really friendly playerbase. now that the game is dead and devs no longer develop or even bug fix major issues, i cannot recommend this game as an mmo. if you want to treat it as a single player or coop game, then i still think you may have fun with the three characters mentioned and there is a lot to do on the map involving pets, alchemy, fishing, exploring, quests, and dungeons (which may be hard alone). however, progression gets increasingly grindy to reaching end game for a dead game.",1724802675,0,,173578284
"valve index user

skyrim's engine is old and it's physics are based on frame rate. when i heard skyrim was coming to vr i thought that meant they would put the work in to fix that. they didn't. if you're playing with a valve index you'll need to set the index's refresh rate to 90, otherwise the intro cart will glitch out and never make in all the way to the fort.

you'll also need to find community key bindings because they didn't bother to add native support for the index controllers either. this isn't too hard, but it won't fix the button prompts on screen.

i was able to get around the issues above, but i've finally given up on skyrim vr because of hotkeys. without hotkeys you have to pause the game to switch between spells/items. there are mods they enable gestures for this, but couldn't any of them to work.

"played on quest 2 through virtual desktop

first 3-hour impression. first off, the game can be a bit confusing at the start this is not a bad thing, but new players need to be aware of that.

i played the tutorial twice and started a new game twice. the tutorial was pretty good. if you take your time you will learn much about the mechanics of the game. two areas that need to be a bit better and the explanation and use of the flashlight cutting through ¡°things¡± that might hurt you. i was confused about the use of flashlight as i did not see it do anything in the tutorial. when you get the flashlight it references that it blazes a trail through somethings. in the tutorial i turned on the flashlight and just walked and saw nothing reacting to the light and was not able to understand its proper use. the last issue i had in the tutorial was ladders. i climbed up the ladder to the guard tower/ hunting stand with no issues. but trying to climb down i could not figure it out. so, in perfect gaming mode i just jumped. this was not an issue in the tutorial, but i think it will be more of an issue of the game mechanics. this could have been me just having a brain fart but if there are tips on how to go down the ladder like that one found the tutorial it could be on a note or something. oh, i loved gun cleaning and i found it strangely relaxing. 

on to the game

i started a new realistic game. with all the information coming at you as a new player it would have been good to be able to see all the tips from the tutorial so they can be reviewed after an event happens.  during my first new game i ran into a few areas where i was being kill for no apparent reason. as stated above the tutorial was not clear as to what these areas could be. these areas of death confused me as i only remembered to use a probe, but they probe had no reactions. as a result, i did not know why i was being killed which was very frustrating. i do not mind getting hurt but not understanding why i was getting hurt was confusing. after some external research i was informed about the proper use of a flashlight.
since i was not far into the game i restarted. this went much better. i went to the depot again. i love the atmosphere. i killed some translucent looking monsters with my knife. it was going well. what got me was when i panicked. i know i should not have, but i did. i was holding my backpack and getting ready for my next area of exploration when one of the monsters snuck up on me. i thought i had killed them all. it screamed and i froze then began to panic as it approached me. i had forgotten i was in a vr game. i was there in my head. sure, i had plenty of time to stop what i was doing and kill it but i brilliantly chose that panic was the proper course of action. this resulted in me throwing my knife and missing, getting hit by the monsters, pulling my gun and forgetting i already had the safety off so i put the safety on so no bang bang for me, pulling my shotgun only to drop it, before i finally got my pistol¡¯s safety off and killing the creature. yep, i am going to love this game.

overall, the atmosphere is creepy to say the least.  i found myself constantly looking over my shoulder as i just got the feeling that something was there, but nothing was there. while i was searching the depot, i often heard a door creaky open and that constantly kept me on edge. as i went back into a hallway i stopped for a moment as i could not remember if i had left a door open. as night fell it got dark. i mean real dark. i was not afraid but was concerned i would not be able to make it back or just meet my demise. in the tutorial you learn that flashlights may attract the monsters, so i was using it sparingly. the feeling of relief as i made it back to the fog that took me to my base was amazing. as i said before yep, i am going to love this game.
 
with that i called it a day, turned in my mission and sorted out all my loot. i am looking forward to playing more of this game.",1617204349,0,0,364863

this game is very lazily done graphics wise and super sloppy..

-index controllers finger support doesn't work
-leg tracking isn't supported

audio is lacking so much..
-peoples audio is very poor quality even though the microphone audios would be very high definition on other games.
-game doesn't have ambient sounds, wind, bugs, birds chirping nothing... it has music on the background but that's it.

-smooth turning was really slow and you cannot change the speed of it.
you can turn irl faster but nobody wants to get their headset wire tangled in the longrun..
-i wish you could autorun via button because people will end up with joystick drift in the long run!
-the window that shows other players info, mute block etc pops out too easily. it gets infront of your view all the time when u look at someone.

edit: okay maybe a little more than yes for a game this good. 

this game is one of those you just can't get enough of and once you thought that you'd gotten enough there's a huge update and you get so much new content that you spend another month playing it nonstop. it's really that good. 

the guns are of course the main aspect of the game and like there wasn't enough guns already, new guns are being implemented to the game regularly. there's multiple different ""maps"" which most of are some sort of shooting ranges. then there's the good things that you spend most of your time on. capture and hold... i can't get enough of it. it's seriously so good. just going from point a to point b killing hotdogs with better and better guns the further you progress. it's also very customizable when it comes to how you wan't to play it. you can change what kinds of guns you get, your health, difficulty progression etc. it's nice. 

it's also very well optimized. before i upgraded to my 1080ti, i had an r9 285 which is below the minimum spec for the vive, but it ran smooth. consistent 90fps on 1.0 resolution scale. and it still looked amazing. the gun models are extremely detailed so you can even read the ""fine print"" on the guns. it's also very stable. i can't remember it crashing once. no problems what so ever. even tho this game is in early access it really doesn't feel like that xd. you could've easily charged 60 of this and i still would've bought it without hesitation. 

if there were one single thing i'd like to see from this game in the futrure, that would be multiplayer. not some random deathmatch, but just being able to stand in the same room with my friends would already be more than enough.",1515417362,3,0,474851
"this review is based on my experience with game having only played it in vr with a controller.

i have to say i'm pretty split on this game. i think senua is one of the most compelling characters in video game history, set in a great world to a very solid story; this is all let down by lack-luster game play. the game swaps between basically puzzle sections and fighting sections. the puzzle sections are always three different type that have the same idea: be in a certain play and look a certain way. while they are neat, they aren't fun or interesting and i never feel clever for figuring them out, which basically means they are bad puzzles. the combat is basically clunky dark souls with one massive, glaring issue: the combat spaces are far, far too small. most of the combat is senua circling around half a dozen enemies packed into a tiny space and trying to not die; it is satisfying, but also feels unfair, claustrophobic, and frustrating especially with the 'dark rot' mechanic, but i'll avoid spoiling that, because i looked it up myself and became even more dissapointed.

oddly enough i started the game finding the puzzles tedious and annoying and enjoying the combat (when there were only a few enemies at most per fight), but by the end of the game i enjoyed the puzzles more and the combat became a real slog to get through, i found myself groaning with annoyance each time senua drew her sword.

overall a decent experience and i really think it lends itself very well to vr in a great way. i think if you want to play this in vr it is worth it simply because how well the story adapts to the platform, otherwise i'd actually warn people away from it, despite thumbing this up. it's a cool game, but i can't look past the game play here. game play is like a 4/10, story is a 10/10, and the game comes to around a 6/10 for me in the end; positive, but only just.",1586639471,0,0,697160

also i  wish this was pinball fx 3 and had more tables, especially real life tables.

this is the future of pinball and along with beat saber it¡¯s the only reason i still use the vive. i hope zen continues to work on new tables and works out multi-platform purchases (like every other developer has) because i¡¯m done purchasing the same table over and over again!",1545188086,0,0,563510

"when you first heard ""virtual reality"" & imagined what it would be like to actually be inside a video game, this is what you imagined. it feels like being inside half life universe and it's much scarier in vr. yeah, head crabs are scary on screen but they look so small. head crabs in this game are large, and dodging when one throws itself at your head, then turning around and wondering which box it's hiding behind is exhilarating. the sense of scale really has to be felt to be believed. voice acting is top notch, cut scenes (which you're in, not just watching) and jump scares are masterfully done. there's combat, zombies, exploration, comic relief & storytelling. easily the best game in vr.

[b]additional[/b]
just like half life did the first time round, valve have used a new technology to showcase what's possible. in vr, alyx is full of intuitive actions and motions to interact with the game world. you can target objects in the world and flick them towards you, then snatch them out of the air with your gravity gloves. reloading means actually putting bullets in your gun, dodging means physically hiding behind a wall. one bit that particularly stood out to me was a dark section where you're using the wrist-mounted torch in a very dark area, only... you also need that hand to reach over your shoulder, grab ammunition and put it in your gun, which means you can't see what's coming in the dark while you're reloading.

in addition to that, you can...
+ pick up everything
+ hold objects from different positions (most vr games just lock the object to your hand in a pre-defined place)
+ turn knobs on the radio
+ throw and break bottles (which now have simulated liquid inside them)
+ use a pen to draw on the window
+ with the valve knuckles, holding a plastic bottle and squeezing the controller, squeezes the bottle

[b]pros[/b]
+ it's 15 hours long. an actual full length game in vr rather than just a tech demo
+ the music is just as awesome as the other half life games
+ unbelievable attention to detail. many objects look real & have legible writing and details on them
+ exploration is rewarding; not only for the ammunition and upgrade materials but also discovering hidden rooms and set pieces
+ beautiful graphics and lighting
+ perfect framerate, despite being gorgeous and in vr
+ lots of movement options. i love that a game this long allows teleport movement. i want to play saints and sinners, but i can't because you have to move with a stick.
+ also inline with making things adapted for vr; all your guns can be upgraded - and one of those upgrades for each gun is a laser sight which really helps when you don't have a crosshair on your screen
+ the npc who guides you over the radio is the band manager from flight of the conchords, with genuinely funny dialogue
+ you should read one of the reviews about how much user testing they did for this game and how they built it; it's fascinating. everything in the world has been placed and re-placed to make sure that players always have enough ammo, but also feel like they don't quite have enough. also worth reading is the interview where valve talks about the various reasons why they didn't put the crowbar in the game (it kept getting stuck on things)
+ when i heard it was going to be a sequel, i assumed it would just slot right into the existing story, but it does actually add to the lore and is full of surprises
+ as if the whole experience wasn't brilliant enough, the last hour of the game is really special

[b]cons[/b]
- the zombies can throw objects at you, but you can't damage enemies by throwing objects at them. previous flat-screen half-life games allowed you to kill enemies by throwing/launching stuff at them so this feels like a little step backwards especially when everything in the game can be picked up and thrown. considering how realistic everything else is, it feels odd to throw a brick at a head crab and have it just bounce off. when you've got a head crab flying at you, the first reaction is to hit it with what's in your hand rather than firing at it. that being said, i understand why they've done it because they've deliberately limited ammo and want reloading to be scary, so if you could kill everything by just flinging buckets and chairs at them it would take away some of the challenge
- there are only 3 weapons in the game. that does seem few, but actually they all fill a role and it allows for better management of ammo. i wouldn't have minded a rocket launcher though
- combat on normal mode is quite unforgiving - you die very quickly if you're not hiding. unlike normal pc games where you press a button to crouch behind an object, doing this in vr can be a challenge for people like me with bad knees. moving around a battlefield while crouching can be quite painful. there is an easy mode though - which i didn't use, but it's there for people who just want to experience the game",1590946582,0,0,543261

i'm a deafie software developer, and really need to see software such as these gain subtitles.   as founder of blur busters and inventor of testufo, i actually had a contract with the oculus kickstarter (pre-facebook) to help them with low-persistence for virtual reality.  but, myself, i am a deafie!

oculus store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""subtitles: yes/no"" field like steamvr does. i heard through a friend that some group at gallaudet university (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to oculus to humbly request oculus to make a minor change to oculus store (a subtitles yes/no checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a vr game has subtitles or not.

"i have been looking for a more fleshed out rpg with sword and board combat after having played vanishing realms and the description of this game was promising, however, in the end this game is simply bad and doesn't make fun to play through.

1. disappointing melee combat: this game makes the same major mistake some other vr games are doing, you feel like swinging around a stick that floats through all enemies. even haptic feedback is worse than in most games.
2. false advertising: while you do have a sword and shield at your disposal, in the end the sword is actually used to shoot out projectiles. the game is more like a shooter than a sword fighting game.
3. active vr combat? another lie: you are simply teleporting around and actually don't have to move your own body that much. just aim with your sword (how ridiculousis that!) and shoot your enemies. with your sword.
4. bad animation: the enemies move hilariously bad. most of the enemies i've met only had 1 (one!) single attack animation. of course melee combat won't be exciting that way.
5. bad sound mixing: there are some sounds that are way too loud, others are the opposite. very jarring experience. voice acting sometimes sounds like it is coming from a poor synthesizer, while it was much higher quality in the intro.

the core gameplay is flawed. it looks more like to me the developer here did put more effort into the quantity of loot and upgrades (mostly cosmetic and just increases some arbitrary numbers) rather than trying to actually make the core gameplay work and be fun at the same time.

i don't recommend this game to anyone. we have so many good vr games right now that are more polished, nailed the core gameplay and are simply fun. don't bother with this one.",1483538109,3,0,564109

"half life has always been a series that is driven by a dark sci-fi experience. alyx is no different. with the all new controls, due to vr exclusivity, alyx provides users a new way of seeing city 17 and the horrors that lurk behind every corner. alyx is both scary, funny and at times peaceful. yet there's never a lack of action or feeling of engagement. though both dialogue and interactive world you'll be listening to the story as you play with bottles or shoot headcrabs. 

the only con is that owning a vr headset to play alyx is outside of many people's price range. likewise, a gaming setup that can play alyx will also run you up if you don't already have one. 

all in all, alyx provides an interesting story, but focuses more attention to its interactivity. the feeling of playing is what i walked away with. this is unlike playing half life 2, where my experience was guided by story and characters. here things seem a little too artificial.

"although this game has very positive to overwhelmingly positive ratings, i cannot recommend it.

it looks and feels like a unity game. its not pretty to look at, and its made worse that the first mission you do takes place during daytime. so you immediately have to notice.
the enemies are black shadows and blobs, which is so frustratingly generic, uninteresting and not even slightly scary.
the way the story is trying to be told is also immediately off-putting. a ghost talking your ear off, vague scattered notes everywhere and not a single npc otherwise.

i want to like and enjoy this game, but sadly it is bland and it really just feels like a mediocre unity game on every level.
a large portion is the game is dedicated to inventory management and fumbling around with your equipment which slowls you down. which would be fun, but the technical quality of everything makes it janky.

one experience i had was retrieving an item, so you wander around, navigate through anomalies, kill a shadow thing or two. all fine.  then i enter a building and start getting hurt. it isn't clear why to me. there isn't a good hint, a sound cue or anything to indicate what is going on. i move around, then die. then i see what killed me: black grass.
you'd think they have a sound cue, or flat out the protag saying the grass is hurting him - considering they have all manners of ghosts talk to him like he is having a schizophrenic break. sadly there isn't anything.

coop would make it immensely more fun, but so far i am not impressed.

"what an odd game. boneworks has absolutely no shortage of jank; limbs and weapons and enemies are regularly clipping into each other, and often times the melee weapons hit like wet noodles until you get used to the combat system. i think the physics-based body just looks weird, and despite all the hype it gets, i don't think smooth movement is really that more immersive than teleportation.

fans are hyping this game up as the future of vr and... i agree. despite its flaws, when this game gets going it kills! having to physically reload guns mid firefight is fantastic, and being able to physically push around props and open doors makes older vr games feel like they were made in the jurassic era. the jank of the physics kind of even works in the games favor sometimes, as you are able to manipulate it to force puzzle solutions that wouldn't be possible in a more heavily scripted game.

i suspect that in a few years, as more polished and focused games using this kind of physics interactivity come out, boneworks is going to feel pretty dated. (i wouldn't be surprised if some of those games will be made by stress level zero themselves). but right now, this game feels like the cutting edge in what vr games can pull off, and i heavily recommend it to any experienced vr user.

just a hint, if you are throwing items up in the air, which you might want to do from time to time, use an underhand throw or just flick it overhand. i hit my ceiling with the controller a few times before i learned that!

"steam offers ways to access your desktop through the menu button on your vr controllers. it's convenient, but that's about it.

-resize the monitors
-add as many monitors as you want
-easily interact with your desktop with an accurate mouse and scrolling system
-simply look at your wrist (similar to a watch) and see your total time played, controller charge in an accurate percentage and the time without pressing so much as a single button
-seamlessly use all of these features while in a vr game space without breaking the immersion, so you can pole dance like a degenerate in vrchat and change your youtube music at the same.

you can see his dedication through the numerous replies to the reviews on this page and in the forums for the product. highly suggest getting this app if you find yourself disliking the default steam menu. it's certainly a step up. as is the customer support.",1582830168,5,2,374652

"this is nothing more than a cash grab from a developer. from a indie dev this would be fine but from a triple a dev this is unaceptable. scopes do not work making a large amount of the weapons pointless. when i say they do not work i mean that you can not use snipers or any weapont that has a scope on them because this is just a expensive poorly made mod. 
melee weapons are broken with how fast you have to be swinging and some of them can be abused to repedatly hit enemies in quick sucession. continuing with gameplay vats is broken with aiming in it being extremely difficult and making a large part of the game difficult to use. a way to fix it would be to allow scrolling with the touchpad instead of having to point, since most of the tiem you end up pointing no where near your target to actually shoot them

the menue navigation is the worst ive seen for a vr game using the pipboy is one of the worst things due to the controls for it making extremly difficult to scroll through your items. 

aside form the gameplay issues they didnt change alot of the story scripting to acomodate vr a instance of this is coming out from cryo. they have the audio play for you falling over but you are locked in place unable to move. a triple a dev charging $60 couldnt change audio files or change soem scripting? most people are being to forgiving simply because of the fact that this is fallout 4 and arent judging if fairly. 

in conclusion i would not recomend until the following are adressed 
- scopes are usable 
- melee and unarmed weapons are fixed 
- pip-boy menu navigation is fixed 
- performance is fixed 
- scripting changes to acomodate for lack of first and third person animations 
- vats is made usable or a better system is implemented",1514821448,2,0,602281

"this game is a an absolute blast to play. the core movement mechanics for each of the class are unique and fun and more importantly it just [i]feels good[/i] to play.

with the sniper you can grapple to nests and pick off targets from a distance / escape from danger quickly. if there are no nests in your immediate viscinity you can launch a translocator type of object which teleports you to where it lands after it bounces a few times. 

as the jailbreak class you can literally climb the environment like doctor octopus swinging yourself violently all over the place picking off people as you rush towards them. you can use your hooks to kill people too, it's especially funny to grapple someones head and rip it off.

multiplayer which is the core component of the game is pretty seamless thus far, i've played handful of hours as both the host and as a client and i haven't really experienced noticable lag.

i have a 1080ti, so this isn't saying much, but the game runs absolutely fantastic on my 1080ti. i haven't had any reprojection in the most recent updates and my settings are on the default for anyone curious.

the more recent updates have definitely improved on the core gameplay. i believe there was an issue with the single player component not running with all the new updated stuff and they had to take it out. other than that i will say that the single player component was vastly inferior to the experience you can have now in the multiplayer segment. i think in my last session with the devs they mentioned co-op campaign so that would be fantastic!

they have inverse motion (where you lean) as an option for movement (off by default), and each class has their own inherant / balanced movement abilities built in so you get to choose your preferred playstyle.. there's definitely a lot of variety as far as movement goes and i'm sure as they add more content to the game we'll see those options become more plentiful. it's important to note that movement is tied to the character you play as, which is this games take on the movement issues within the vr ecosystem and surprisingly works really well because it gives every player the opportunity to play the game in a way they are comfortable. 

overall the game is definitely a blast and i would personally recommend it. it's not your generic vr shooter that's for sure.",1515624622,3,0,486172

"ive had this game for like 2 weeks now... look at my hours.... yea... this game rocks. where to begin? this game is basically you travelling through the oasis in ready player one but instead of being for gamers looking for games it was made to model out of real life, their creation is called myth os. you play as author ford who works for the company that made myth os and all their systems have shut down. it is your mission to go to the clock tower and restart it. the game plays as a parkour shooter with cool slow motion action and a wide range of melee and ranged weaponry. theres lot of player choice. you can solve a problem with a multitude of ways. and this game hits a wide range of just stuff. wanna unlock different parts of the map getting better gear along the way untill you complete it, fighting zombies and crablets (headcrabs basically) along the way? lemme introduce you to warehouse. wanna play a call of duty zombies style of game where you have to survive as long as possible? try the zombie game mode. want to play a first person shooter type of game? try runoff. want to fight in a sandbox type arena where you can choose what enemies you want to fight and even have allies, do you want to even have an all out war with midevil weaponry? try the arena gamemode. want to get terrified as zombies try to eat you around every corner, even hiding behind boxes to terrify you? try sewers. this game even has a sub plot of you investigating higher ups using null bodies (the things that helped create myth os) to make them make melon makers (things that make melons basically) to sell them to sewer people who need a supply of food, uncovering how corrupt they are to exploit something meant to help build the world around them for greed. like this game has so much. i just wish the game had more diversity with weapons. its all assault rifles and pistols. no revolvers or anything like that. but here comes the next part

the mods. this game has a small yet devoted modding communty with about 200 mods on thunderstore, which makes it super easy to download and manage mods. you literally download the mod manager, select the game you want. select what profile you want (this can help with organizing what mods you want) and click a button to download the mod. want to skip the boring grind of getting every weapon and item in boneworks to use for sandbox because it takes hours? theres a mod that bypasses that. want more weapons like revolvers, deagles, snipers and more? theres a mod for that. want to have a horror expirence of a lifetime (maybe idk havent played it yet because im a big baby)? theres a mod for that. want to summon random fords to then kill in a multitude of ways including stabbing, shooting, whacking, cutting, and just using plain physics? theres a mod for that, heck you can do that in base game! but mods make it easier.

the story. this next part is spoilers so i wouldnt read it unless youve played through the game and were confused on the story. the game theorists goes over this and goes as far as predicting stress level 0's next game. so i recomend you watch their videos on it. but the story, its dense, and it is hard to find. you start the game as ford whos helping myth os servers to get back online because some corporate espionage happened and sombody from the inside hacked their servers and booted everybody out and turning the null hostile (the builders of myth os). then the game turns into a medevil fantasy world where you have to fight clones of yourself to be king and then the game ends off with you opening a door that says boneworks do not open. obviously you open it because flab nabbit im not letting a door tell me what to do! and the game ends with people from myth os shooting your real life body while your surrounded by creepy black humanoid figures, who youve seen before just... watching you. and then the game ends. but the lore is so hidden deep that once you figure it out you realize the entire game is the exact opposite than what you thought it was. spoilers again, but you play as author ford, you disabled the servers so you alone can get inside the clock tower and through that you use myth os to access the void which it uses often, like making those melons made by the melon makers i mentioned earlier to enter the void itself which is a dimension full of fnaf rejects to gain immortality, and gain access to spawn in the real world at any time, but at the same time doom the entire world by giving those fnaf rejects the same ability to enter the real world. and this is deeeeeeeeeep. this is what we know off 2 games. theres going to be 2 more coming out eventually. one being about tracking down radio frequencies to hunt (a) cryptid(s) and the last one about fighting against those fnaf rejects who have taken over robots across the world, with the end boss (maybe) being author ford. this is all speculation but all signs point to this being true. again watch the game theorists videos on this game and duck hunt, which explain this a lot better than i do, and i didnt even talk about how duck season fits into this, and oh boy does it

my reveiw edit just decided to yeetus deletus itself so i guess ill just... write it again... woo... oh yea, im also editing it because theres only 1 thing wrong which i found at like hour 30 and like everybody loves my review, so, here we go again :/
ok so theres only 1 thing wrong with the entire game, and its the melee combat. you cant slice things and you can only stab things. the slicing to my knowledge comes from you stabbing them a tiny bit so the only thing you can do is stab. the other thing is the shield's and gun's melee damage is bugged and if u hit sombody with it, ramming speed, you literally just 1 shot them, which kinda sucks but hey, other than that the game is perfect. after this there was also supposed to be somthing good after this to balance it out but steam reviews suck and it deleted it. if you want proof the game is the bomb just look at my hours, id have so many hours now if my computer wasnt a piece of crap that only has 8 gigs and over heats every 30 min while playing a aaa game. 

oh yea and the thunderstore has over 600 mods now, most are guns, but some are like maps, super strength, and force grab enemies, which is my favorite, i can be darth ford. the most popular mods are very uniqe (spelling, my god my spelling sucks) like land mines, g-mod tool gun, which is one of the best ones, ive used so many times. theres also a mod that changes the ford player model into a ford car, spider man, and lightsaber mods. and thats not that many mods considering theres 631 and more counting. the game is great, tons of endless hours

oh yea i remember what else i had to say about the game thats good! the gun models are the freaking bomb, and the gun physics and the reloading and the cocking back of the gun, its so realistic. when i just need a time killer or im not doing anything i just stare at the models. like for instance with the 1911 grip (basically how the internet percives a dessert eagle (even though dessert eagles in real life suck)) is so realistic you can feel the texture just by looking at it, thats how much work they put into a simple gun model. a fun glitch with the mods i downloaded made it where the 1911 is invisible, now i just carry around a clip with a trigger on it. its very amusing. anyway you have a great day, thanks for suffering through me ranting about how great this game is for 30+ min, i really like this game and i appreciate when people like and listen to what i have to say

"i would like to preface my review by commenting that i am a longtime pc gamer who about a couple months ago bought a quest 2  and was amazed at the curated vr experiences in the quest 2 store until i found a variety of ports of pc games, mostly older games but that were so amazing i have hardly played any of the little quest 2 built-in store offerings (which mostly feel like tech demos and phone games) since! serious sam 3 is one of the newest pc port games that still runs well wirelessly via virtual desktop on my modest (by vr standards) pc. i remain confused as to why pc ports like serious sam 3 are not more popular. sure the android/phone style games are cool, but  to play a full blown full-size pc first person shooter truly is what vr was made for. i guess some people don't like these games in vr because they have motion sickness, but i do not have that problem and i disable all the ""comfort"" settings so it runs like a regular fps on pc except through vr with motion controllers. the experience is off the charts amazing, and this game is one of the best i have played. also, these serious sam games (1st and 2nd encounter are also available via vr) worked for me right out of the box, aside from tweaking up the resolution (i was able to get a smooth experience higher than the auto-detected quality). many other pc ports require a ton of setup to make them usable (efforts that may be well-rewarded like for games like skyrim) but i appreciated that this game looked and ran awesome right out of the box, even using the 3rd party app virtual desktop so i didn't have to plug in. thus i would recommend this as a good starting game if someone is a little hesitant about some of the less ready-to-go pc port games out there.",1641870498,3,0,579318

"i think this game may have really good potential but right now it is frustrating and tds. i have 3000 hours in vr in my system is plenty capable of handling it. you¡¯ve seen in the other reviews about the two hour long tutorial that glitchy and slow and tells you things that you think should be obvious and that takes forever. somethings just don¡¯t seem to quite work unless you¡¯re hovering your hand over the exact millimeter of space to trigger it. the wording is odd and i had to read instructions two or three times in each step and there¡¯s about 30 to 40 steps. there¡¯s a lot of neat potential but right now it is a pretty buggy experience. picking things up off the ground lots of times doesn¡¯t work or it just grabs something off your belt instead. i have index controllers and i feel like barely gripping the controller while i am walking and pushing the joystick causes me to pick up the sword out of my holster and i¡¯ll drop it and i don¡¯t know it when it happens so i lose weapons constantly.every time you kill a skeleton almost you get a jewel that you¡¯re supposed to grab and throw to the ground sometimes it just bounces off the ground so then you have to do the thing where you try to pick it up without grabbing weapons out of your bell and you have a 1 cm area directly in front of you where you can grab some thing off the ground if you bend over without grabbing something off your belt instead and then you try again and again. then you go to figure out how to put the thing in your inventory because you don¡¯t need it right now but it¡¯s hard to find money so do you want to sell it later so you have to drop the weapon you¡¯re currently holding and then you have to point and click on unequipped which puts it in your inventory then you pick back up your weapon off the ground without anything else going wrong and then you move onto your next skeleton. the skeletons surround you and if there¡¯s more than one or maybe two which often happens, it¡¯s really really difficult and you¡¯re just kind of trying to back up but your guy doesn¡¯t move very fast and certainly doesn¡¯t back up very fast so you kind of just get into a corner and die. when you die you start back in town and you have to go travel across the town back into the dungeon where you were to pick up your crap and then make it through a couple more rooms. it¡¯s just very very tedious right now with how you have to pick up and hold things and put things in your inventory and throw the crystals on the ground after you kill the guy to get stuff. if that was made to be more smooth like motions are on tails of glory then it would be pretty good but it¡¯s not. it¡¯s clunky and frustrating. i don¡¯t recommend getting this game until it¡¯s much more along in development. there isn¡¯t really a story and nobody talks to you so it¡¯s just kind of a dead ash world that you¡¯re not sure what the point is of going through it. if you play with a friend it¡¯s probably a lot more fun but the trickiness of just grabbing things and working with your inventory needs to be sorted out. if they sort this out i will buy it again",1631499529,0,0,411549

"ridiculously good game. when i bought it, i kind of expected it to be just another crappy game that i would end up refunding, but i was honestly blown away. there is so much to do, so many levels to visit, and so much stuff to interact with, you genuinely feel like you're in the backrooms. 

probably what i appreciate the most about this game is that it isn't really a horror game. yes, there are horror elements and you probably will have to change your pants a few times, but it's also about the exploring. other backrooms games feel like the goal is to, well, escape the backrooms. brvr on the other hand creates a need to explore everything, there is just so much to find on every level. even simply exploring level 0 over and over again continually rewards me with new discoveries!

"let me just go out and say; this game really has a lot of potential. i truly mean that. if you're as passionate as me when it comes towards the nfl and football in general, you will have a blast with this game. but, with that being said there are so many possibilities that this game can achieve. from what i heard the developers are planning to make nfl pro era a yearly release. sort of like madden. personally i feel like this is a step in the wrong direction. this game has the potential to be something really great. it needs all the focus, attention, and player base it can get. hopefully with future updates and patches this game can excel at what it does best, and what it does specifically is being a damn good quarterback simulator, but one out of the many things i just feel like it's missing is more of a control aspect. obviously at the start of each game you can choose if you want to kick or receive when you win the coin toss, but in 4th down situations you should really have more control whether you want to go for it or not. not just automatically punting or kicking a field goal. besides that one small nitpick all of the stadiums are all wonderfully crafted as well as the sound effects being extremely well made in this game. the graphics are really good, and i was very immersed while trying to avoid 310 pound men from killing me. in the future i would love to see action in other positions, not just the quarterback position. normally, i don't write many reviews on steam, but this game has specifically peaked my interest and i'm extremely invested in what the future holds for the nfl pro era.",1672214872,0,,129498712

"mechanically, this is very solid. it is simple and fun, with everything that happens feeling like it was the correct result (this is important in a paddle game).

it has one major flaw. the room size retirement is completely unnecessary, and yet it makes the game unplayable. i am rating this positively since it lists that requirement on the store page.

in my 2.2x2.2 meter space all items of the menu are easily reachable. the main gameplay (volleying the ball) works perfectly as well. the only problem is that every single mine spawns outside the play space. that gives a hard limit on how far i can get because sooner or later (usually within ten hits) the ball hits a mine that i can't deal with.

giving multiple room options (possibly with adjusted scoring to compensate) would make this game far more approachable.

edit:
after writing this i thought to myself ""what if i could reach the mines? all i had to do was shift my z position forward half a meter (thanks steamvr advanced settings!) and i could reach them just fine. my high score is now 160 and i worked up a serious sweat.

the ball still sometimes gets shot outside my play space, but for the most part the game works great just by offsetting myself forwards.

"tevris is a ripoff of tetris (copyright 1984, alexey pajitnov).  the only innovation here is that it's a (badly made) vr version (hence the name, tevris).  apart from being vr exclusive, there's no other differentiation from the product, so we can just cross our fingers and hope the developer gets sued.  copyright infringement is no laughing matter, and it does a grave disservice to the gaming industry. 

from a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most pc gamers expect as standard.

the game features lazy minimalist/untextured low-polygon ""retro"" assets and visuals, making this look like a barely functional 3d game from the early 1990s.  the lack of textures is a method that lazy devs often use to disguise their lack of talent/interest in doing the graphics properly and trying to disguise it under the name of ""art"", or ""we made it look bad on purpose"", which really isn't something gamers should have to put up with.  it's unclear why the developers weren't willing to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets and high resolution textures for the game.  it looks bad as a result of their decisions, and that's just another reason to avoid it.

this seems to have been made a vr exclusive to prevent any comparison with non-vr 3d games, a comparison that this game would fail very badly at.  developers must learn that while vr is great, if the only thing that makes the game great is the vr, then the game isn't great at all.

these technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern pc game.

the poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  at the time of this review, steamdb shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  this is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  considering there's over 120 million gamers on steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.

tevris is relatively cheap at $1 usd, but it's not worth it. given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.",1684239474,0,,138377647

the level design, modeling, texturing, lighting, character design, art direction, voice overs, story line, music, sound effects...literally every aspect of this game is magnificently executed.

"[h1]tl;dr[/h1]
bullet roulette is a vr game where you sit at a table with 3 other characters with a revolver in the core of the table. it works as russian roulette with the twist of cards which can decide your fate (or other character¡¯s fates). it is a last man standing gun game. the more times you pull the trigger at your head and survive, the more coins you get. with each coin, you can then pull the trigger at someone other than yourself. overall, playing it with friends really made the game enjoyable and we had a load of funny moments. therefore i highly recommend this game [b]if you have buddies to play it with[/b]. 

[b]contents: gameplay, performance and visuals[/b]

[h1]gameplay[/h1]
you start off by assembling at a circular table with a revolver in the centre, with 3 other players. each member of the circular table is given 3 cards allowing them to manipulate the gun or the outcome (such as spinning the barrel, checking it etc.) for the first rotation, everyone has to pull the trigger at their heads. if you die, you have to sit there for the remainder of the match. if you survive, you get a coin. this coin allows you to shoot at another person. me and my friends got really confused when we started out as we went in blind, however it came clear to us.

the gameplay was really fun to us. it was a basic, yet unprecedented, approach of russian roulette. we did roleplay, we put on humorous voices. although they were the most common and some would say ¡®boring¡¯ things to do, we still had a lot of delightful moments which we¡¯ll remember. notwithstanding being fun and all of that, it does have flaws.

first of all, the multiplayer is stagnant. unless you have mates to play with (or find people via the discussions), you¡¯ll end up competing against ai or having the rare chance of finding a game to join. secondly, the gameplay can feel tiresome very quickly. there¡¯s no exceptionally big twist to it and it¡¯s constantly got the same soundtrack, map and npcs going around in the same sequence every game. for the cost of the game, i would highly advise waiting until a sale. 

[h1]optimisation and visuals[/h1]
the graphics are simply designed. they¡¯re neither too magnificent nor too basic. though, me and my friends did struggle with some frame drops every now and then. this is definitely something the developers need to look out for. however these drops only last a round and then they generally fix themselves.

[b]overall, this game is amazing and great and brings a unique twist to the russian roulette game style. therefore i recommend this game if you have friends to play it with!  [/b]

"beat saber is a wonder of vr. it's a rhythm game that deserves whatever praise it can get. (tl;dr at bottom.)

+ pros:
 - great for exercise if you can't/don't go outside.
 - satisfying feeling of just slicing blocks in half.
 - engaging and addicting gameplay, especially if this is your first vr game.
 - enough content to let you spend hours on end playing.
 - lots of replayability.
 - controls are smooth, refined and feels natural.
 - one hell of a modding community that makes it super duper easy to mod whatever you want, without risk of game 
    corruption.
 - official maps are all hand-crafted perfectly to feel in-tune with the music.
 - one of few games where practice makes a seriously noticeable difference.
 - visuals are absolutely astounding!

- cons:
 - harder levels are pretty heavy on the hardware, especially expert+.
 - the skill gap between hard - expert and expert - expert+ difficulties is unreasonably large, considering easy - hard is 
    pretty narrow of a gap.
 - campaign mode, although satisfying, has some stupid requirements sometimes (i.e. encouraging bad cuts).
 - price has shot up since it's ed phase, i'd wait for a sale.

/ neutral:       (neither pro nor con)
 - dlc is expensive, but mods always provide new content if you get bored.
 - soundtrack isn't the best, but there are a few official songs that are pretty nice to listen to. also modded songs.
 - mods break after every update and hotfix, but the community is pretty damn good at updating quickly.
 - in-game modifiers can add an enjoyable challenge, but isn't practical for getting a better score.
 - it's probably obvious by now, but mods are really what makes the game as good as it is.

notes:
beat saber was one of the first games i got when i first got my vr, and it is also one of my more played games. it's comparatively low storage space requirements and offline compatibility really is convenient to me, as my internet isn't good at all so whenever i lose internet, i can spend a good amount of my time actually doing something other than solitaire. i've found myself playing hours on end by accident, making myself severely dehydrated, but it's worth it because i find legitimate joy for every note i demolish.
i've also recently deduced that playing beat saber, especially at expert/expert+ levels, can help you train to be a better driver. beat saber helps improve skills like hand-eye coordination, accuracy, reaction timing, being able to process multiple entities at a time, and even the attention to detail that is required to drive as safe as possible, and by playing large amounts, i've noticed i've improved significantly in all of these fields.
it also doesn't take long to find people sharing stories of how they have used beat saber as a form of therapy that has helped them cope with accidents that caused brain trauma and physical disability, while also providing psychological relief for unhealthy amounts of stress or other mental illnesses. while ""playing video games"" has a bad reputation for being ""bad for you health"", i would say that at least beat saber has enough credibility to be an acceptable albeit temporary alternative to a prescription with potentially terrible side-effects. (i'm not saying this is a cure, rather a personal treatment for some issues. always consult a doctor.)

tl;dr - fun, satisfying game that is made better with easy-to-use mods and an essential for any vr owner. may also provide health benefits and cognitive improvements. probably get it on sale. 9.3/10

p.s. screw the min/max hand movement requirements on campaign levels. angel breath was just hell. i mean, 1.7 km in 6 minutes? screw off.",1562305822,0,0,640467
"half-life alyx is a testament to valve's prowess in pushing the medium of video games as an experience. this game is not only my goty of 2020, but, for me, stands strongly alongside its predecessors. and in some categories, surpasses them. while the experience unfortunately cannot be had by everyone (non-vr headset owners), it shouldn't take away from sheer quality of what valve has given us. it reminded me why i love video games. it reminded me why i love valve, despite their recent publicity track record. 

much like hades, it excels in every aspect of the game genre it is in. it's the best vr game. mechanically, design-wise, foliage, etc. this needed to be vr, there's no two ways about it. vr is a gimmick, but that doesn't detract from hl:a. if anything, it enhances it. alyx is more vulnerable than gordon or shepard, and that's immediately conveyed as soon as you step into her shoes (or gloves i guess) and pass a strider in the opening view. that's an intimate feeling i don't think would work without the power of vr simply because a player's response and feedback wouldn't be the same as a standard fps.

"this game is very intense, but in a good way. it feels like a better version of medal of honor. 

the story is very clever, having you dive into the memories of an esteemed wwii veteran and reliving his past while he narrates over it. it makes you feel like you¡¯re the one remembering the war, and that you were a part of it at one point.

most sniper elite titles made for flat screen console gaming have the feature of clicking the thumb stick in to hold your breath in order for your character to steady his aim, but in this case, you¡¯re that character, and you have to hold your breath in real life. 

it¡¯s a very surreal feeling to see the damage being done to your enemies up close. this was the case in the other installments of the series, but now that you¡¯re in vr, you¡¯re able to get a very in depth look at the carnage caused from the single bullet shot out of your rifle.

the assault rifles/smgs feel great. they¡¯re some of the first i¡¯ve seen in a vr game that have proper recoil and bullet spray patterns, requiring you to control them more efficiently and fire in short bursts. however, i do wish that you could hold the pistols with two hands, which would help with aiming them.

this game is one of those rare quest titles that is a well polished, story driven shooter. the most we¡¯ve seen is zero caliber: reloaded, which, while it had a decent story, was very janky and unoptimized (which, thankfully is being fixed over time).

for $30, it¡¯s definitely a recommend from me. i suggest that any fan of wwii games or movies should take a look at this one. great job rebellion. keep it up. be proud ??


update 1: bringing my score down to a 4 star because of a very obvious immersion breaker. the star progression. this game is still incredible, but if you¡¯re going to make me grind for red stars in a game about sniping nazis, then the immersion is basically gone. i don¡¯t want to have to replay every mission in the game, just to play it a different way than i did before. it¡¯s meaningless and tedious. i just want to play through the levels and finish the game because i¡¯m curious about the story. but when they want me to halt my progression for stars, i just want to stop playing altogether. at least add some sort of mode to let you play the levels for free without gaining any xp. i just want to see the story play out. 

on top of that, most of the challenges ask you to get a certain score of 2500 or higher. the kicker is that, if your shot isn¡¯t consistent enough, (i.e. not getting enough headshots) you won¡¯t be able to reach that score threshold, even if you use explosives. i have to get three more stars to progress to the next mission, which basically means that i have to reach a certain score threshold for every single level i don¡¯t have three stars for. and my sniping shot isn¡¯t the best. i¡¯m constantly missing shots that i should be hitting because of bullet drop or wind resistance. so i have to grind longer and harder because of it. replaying the same story over and over again feels off to me. rebellion, please take these pointless challenges out of the game with a certain setting that i could turn on or at least make them easier to complete, because now i can¡¯t finish the story because of it. 

again, the game is great. i¡¯m not bashing it in any way, shape, or form. it¡¯s one of the best vr games i¡¯ve ever played. but, the star progression removes the immersion, making it way less fun than it should be.

update 2: i ended up finally beating the game which is took about 6-7 hours of on and off play. and that ending was incredible. the challenges weren¡¯t as hard as they thought, but they are still super tedious to grind out. however, that doesn¡¯t retract from the surreal and immersive experience i had while completing that final mission. and what a final mission that was. 

spoilers ahead: as i climbed the ladder to the top of the lighthouse, my heart started beating harder and louder. and when i reached the top, looked down my scope, and saw the impossible shot that i had to take, my heart nearly stopped. i held my breath longer than i ever had before, and i took the shot. it hit. the game was over. that was one of the most immersive vr experiences i¡¯d ever had. i felt like if i hadn¡¯t hit that shot, all the trials and tribulations that i had just went through would have been for nothing. and when i did hit it, i had a sigh of relief like no other¡­

"so, my friend got this game and i decided to get it so that we could play together. i fired up the game, and when i started the tutorial i was already loving the game. there are many weapons and mechanics, and it sure was interesting seeing a battle royale with building in vr. in my first game, everyone seemed pretty nice, not that toxic, but i do assume that people will get more toxic over time, and the game is relatively hard even if you've played battle royale before like me, at least in your first 25 - 50 matches or so. (obviously just my opinion) i've played maybe 35 matches and it still is pretty hard to win, but that makes it challenging and fun. also, squads are three people, there is training mode, building is only walls and floors, there is 18 people in a match including your squad (6 squads total) and there is a leveling up system for free with lots of cool outfits or skins. (cosmetics, character appearances etc.) there are mics obviously, but one thing i don't like is that you can't mute everyone but your friend(s). but overall, i have had so much fun and i highly recommend this game!",1604892214,5, ,211744

"the best thing by [i]far[/i] on steamvr right now. ignore the ""early access"" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.

what makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: wield your controller as a sword! parry attacks! lunge! chop! once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! use a bow and arrow (like in the lab)! switch between them! yay!

some ""early access"" things do come up. they are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: combat is too easy once you understand it. the enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. i think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other vr games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. finally, 2 hours is not enough! by the time i got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! it would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.

but these seem like nitpicks. all in all vanishing realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising vr rpg future.

if only for labeling this ""early access"" indimo labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the ""full"" releases on steamvr right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments. it's deceitful to sell them at any price. but indimo knows that the fact that vr is new doesn't mean people shouldn't get a complete, working, tested game, and is willing to risk lower sales by using the truthful ""early access"" label. bravo!",1464667837,2,0,431566

"really enjoying this game and it has so much potential, but all the little glitches and issues let it down: 

- if i¡¯m auto switch hands mode it¡¯s impossible to slide the gun and reload. 

- the reward and stats page at the end goes on too long, make it so if all players choose lobby it instantly takes us back rather than standing around awkwardly

- allowing the leader to kick in the rewards and stats page is allowing them to kick you to prevent you getting rewards after long runs as well, highly frustrating.  once you are at the rewards page they should be guaranteed. 

- make it so we can chat in the lobby and make friends for parties 

- i¡¯ve had guns disappear mid runs and can¡¯t figure out why, might be to do with grabbing items from the wrist

- need more storage, appreciate that it¡¯s to make us have to make decisions on what to carry but realistically we should just be able to pick up a keycard when we have a floppy.  my suggestion would be to have it that when you pick up a floppy it disappears and auto displays on the ui for the team and you don¡¯t have to worry about storing it, which seems hard work. 

- depending on the wifi of the leader it can make the run very glitchy and mobs jump around a lot or stand there like scarecrows, maybe look to have your own servers for it to run from.",1670799540,5, ,137180

"i've been searching for vr games that are unique, polished, intuitive and creative. i want something that showcases vr - the scale, intensity, the emotions, the grandeur. this game meets all of those criteria. on top of all of that, the soundtrack provides the emotions i want to feel through each level.

i didn't know what i was getting into with this (somewhat short) game. i thought i was just going to move around cool creatures and witness the interesting interactions between them. well, i got that, and much much more. there were moments of urgency, intensity, calm, joy, sadness, and relief all throughout the game. i developed emotional connections with each and every paper beast, every one unique in its own way. some i loved, some i had fun with, some i despised, and some carried a continual mystery as the levels progressed.

ultimately this is a physics-based puzzle game. the goal is to move creatures and/or objects from one place to another, or to find a way to move yourself to the next level. there are no guides, no words, no rules, no hints whatsoever. every single thing is done on intuition, and more importantly, emotion and curiosity. there are no time limits, and you cannot lose. the game's pace is such that it gently presses you forward at your own pace, no matter how smart or dumb you are, and somehow it manages to do this perfectly without any rebalancing, ai changes, or retries. there are no numbers (except for interesting sky textures and particles), health meters, or level indicators. the polish is incredible for such a small developer. though there were some moments of frustration, ultimately i found that ""ah ha"" moment, and got the greatest satisfaction when i figured out each puzzle, just like valve does with their single-player puzzles. my only genuine frustration with the game was the moments where my movement actions were locked until i realized i was supposed to do something interactive ( these moments were almost entirely within the first 2% of the game).

paper beasts is an absolute jewel of an experience, and i do not make that statement often about games. this game is up there with valve's portal for its ambition, uniqueness, intuition, and grand expression of the platform.

"relatively short game, it was great until the boss fight which was not very intuitive so i had to look at it on the internet twice, so here's how you expose his face:

you point your shotgun at him to make him charge at you (best to stand still during this process), try to stand in front of a pole or wall so that once he charges at you, he hits his face, exposing it for a short time. shoot him in the face once or twice until he does some yoga allowing you to shoot the milk sacks on his back, after which his mask drops to reveal his ugly ahh and it's just a normal fight of shooting him in the face.



apart from that the game was pretty awesome, i've always enjoyed horror but this game had me actually scared for the first time in a long while, maybe because the dead : alive ratio was just right meaning even though i would get jumped a lot it was rare enough for me not to expect it? idk i don't know shit about psychology.

[spoiler]the zombie caseoh jumping out of the wall[/spoiler] was a  nice element that i again did not see coming, also the unscrewing with the drill and cutting was a nice touch instead of just opening the same door with a different number every single time.

may be one other point of critique would be that it seemed to me that the level designers did not have a lot of assets to work with, i constantly saw the same items and even in the same area the exact same table with the same items positioned on it (so copy pasted), but that is only a small distraction and does not ruin the gameplay in any way. (unlike the confusing boss fight)

i feel like with the ending the devs got a bit lazy since it's only audio, but may be that is just on me.

graphics are not stunning but of course it's vr so compared to the average vr game it is pretty good, definetily good enough for me to be immersed.

because it is only a short game i recommend it if you have plenty of vr games that you keep coming back to, if you just spent all of you money on a system and vr setup and only have a little bit of money to spend on games, may be wait this one out  or buy it once it's on sale since you could play the entire game in a single evening if you wanted to (i don't think that would be a good idea though)

overall may be 8.5/10 if you know what to do with the fight (which i didn't spent way too much time running in circles) otherwise a 7.5

"the game is really fun. shooting bad guys, robots, and other creepy things. the stress of dying and having it all end always looming over you, even more intensely as you lose more crew members. the guns feel really nice to use, aside from the disc weapons. the visuals are great aside from a few animation problems. the soundtrack is very nice. and all that alone is the reason it gets a 4 star rating. my problems come down to the ship battles and the end of the game. all ship battles play the same. knock out their shield or tactical depending on your weapon setup, and then kill them, that is, if you don't just board them and kill them from the inside. which is easier and more rewarding anyway. and the last mission... i don't get why you go from dying in 3 hits throughout the game to being practically invincible at the end. it feels like we prepared everything and invested so much when we could've ran in with the 104 damage pistols and no healing and still do fine. even with that disappointing end though, the rest of the game was still fun enough that i didn't have any regrets buying or experiencing this game.",1519874614,5, ,322850
"a fun and interesting game which lets you ""ease"" into vr. controls are decent and the storyline is fun to follow, if not a bit dull at times. voice acting is alright, but could be better. 
the lack of a shield in this game is somewhat dissapointing, and you are not able to dual wield swords, but this is not a big deal. the game feels good, but is somewhat short. worth the money? yes, for sure, but not perfect. i still do recommend this game for most players to try. the lack of a replay value is a shame, but the devs seem very interested in making the game better, so future updates might make the game even better.

all in all, i'd rate it a 6/10. good for the price, and a good, yet short game.",1595240494,0,0,752144

"warning:  this game should be called extreme workout vr.  because that is exactly what it is.  geez, i only played 8 minutes and i'm already all sweaty and tired.  you have to move quickly either to the left, right or middle.  and you have to constantly squat down to avoid the obstacles (basically move to the opening in the wall, the rest of the wall being the obstacle).  you're supposed to be collecting balls while doing the above.  

the coaster is just a big room scale area (get as much roomscale as you can) and that'll be where you can move to quickly avoid the obstacles.  there's easy, normal, and hard levels.  however, the only difference that i noticed was that you could press trigger more often to activate the slow motion (""bullet time"") mode, where time slows down and you can more easily get to the correct spot.  there's also a comfortable option and it just made your view smaller and things blurrier (imo).  good thing i don't ever suffer from vr nausea.

however, even on easy this game is quite the workout.  so i don't recommend this game unless you're willing to play 2 minutes a a time or you are in good shape.  and just forget about it you're completely out of shape.

1) you should consider breaking up the progression lock in between earlier missions so that when the final act comes, players will be nearly ready for it. beat a story mission, require the player to get x% before the next story mission unlocks. in my experience, the progression lock before the final mission was a tad jarring, if only because i'd be excited to see what was next after each mission which meant i needed roughly 25% more support before i could do the final mission which brought the story to a grinding halt.

"i love this game. it¡¯s beauty is in its confidence to keep everything stripped back to basic core mechanics. bow, arrow, movement, floaty physics, ball and a goal at either end. 

personally i enjoy local play with my brother on the same team and we play against bots. this isn¡¯t a criticism of the online play aspect of the game, it¡¯s just that neither of us have ever been interested in playing against unknown people in any game and always enjoyed playing against bots. this game works great with bots as they seem to be programmed to allow for the player to have a bit of autonomy, even at the highest level they appear to hang back a little at times, yet have a strong defence and the occasional powerful offence. we have tried playing with online players, and had varied levels of fun with it and we only encountered friendly and welcoming people.

regarding improvements. i am sure that i can expect to see more bows, maps and avatars to trickle through in updates.

i would be curious to see how customisation options for local play would work out, such as weight of the ball, power of the arrows/bow, ball always on red/destroy mode.

but if it ain¡¯t broke don¡¯t fix it. the above suggestions may dilute what is already a perfect experience and i am perfectly happy with the content just as it is and can see myself picking it up and playing it over and over again.

oh and it¡¯s fantastic value for money!",1653922800,5, ,305203

note: i am playing this on an oculus quest 2 and the other reviewers are incorrect about not being able to use power-ups as the seeker. the tutorial/controls just do not do a good job explaining it. to use power ups as the seeker you simply use the left joystick (or whichever joystick you see the power ups on in the side of with the dashboard). you'll see the symbols in a little triangle on the side of the controller and you have to hold the joystick in the direction of the power up you want to use (left/up/right) and click the stick in (helps to hold it in till you hear/see the power up activate). hope that helps!",1633114553,3,0,577802

gameplay is literally fantasy beatsaber with one song that isn't very good. the crafting mechanics were very fun the first couple of times but to craft a weapon you need ore, which you have to wait for in the mines. if you can't make a second weapon, you genuinely cannot progress past a certain point. sell a sword too early? you're sol and have to wait for the mine to catch up with you.",1720124107,0,,169002553

"jet island
where do i start with this game? it's absolutely amazing, even when going in completely blind.
i heard about this game in a review by upisnotjump in the video ""every vr game is a nightmare, this is why"". don't be confused by the title of the video, however. while some may be turned off by the initial look of it, it's what adds its appeal. it's a dream-like world, and makes me remembers the dreams i used to have as a child. i am in love with this game. it's whatever you make it out to be as well. a speedrun to defeat the bosses? hell yeah. a way to quickly break into your vr legs? most definitely. a totally calming experience to swing around and listen to music to? of course!

while this game is near-perfect, i would recommend some new things in later updates.

in online, i would like to be able to mute my mic. my friend and i were in discord while playing and had a constant echo, only to find out we had to turn down the 'voice volume' in game. this had us confused because it meant how you hear other player's voices, not how they hear yours.

turning is fine for those who don't mind swiping, however, some prefer the 'tap' method on the vive to turn. tap one side, and it turns you to that side, like vrchat. auto turning is a thing, but it makes you feel kind of less in control of where you're going. (but sometimes that's what makes it fun, like in super spin mode.)

a little-uncertain-bird told me that there was map creation on the way. i really hope this is a feature that is implemented later on. to be able to have other people make big cities that could be swung around in would be the ultimate spider-man experience! the community is hella creative, and i know there will be some fun maps if that is added.

from what i know, there isn't a whole lot of story. you're placed into this world, and you figure out on your own that there are bosses that need to be defeated. gigantic ones, and they are absolutely stupendious. you feel like you're taking down titans from attack on titan, and that alone is worth the price of the game.

the developer has heart in it, and you can feel it as well. he truely loves what he's doing and you can hear it in the video reviews. i've played sword master, and that is another fun game by the developer!

overall, i highly recommend this game. it's one hell of a experience and makes you feel like a child again. totally worth the full price, i love it.

the only negative thing about this game is that the career/story mode is way to short. i would love if the story is longer and there are more opponents. i hope they make more for the career mode. right now it feels short. however there is a lot of fun to be had in the pvp mode.

"edit bellow:

devs please hear this, it would increase many more players playtime in this game if you did (i promise, its a very small feature that i would like to have)

so i heard this game was super popular and so i got it without my mum noticing and played it. it was good at first and stuff like the physics in the game were entertaining to play with but the only problem is that i am very short. so when i went into a ""real"" match, i shit my pants so hard because of how big these guys were and it ended out with me on top of a tall structure whacking them in the head with the small stick. i love this game and stuff but i just think there has to be a better sizing system or something because i don't like being short in vr, maybe the quest version will bring a better sizing system like boneworks has, i could play through the whole game and enjoy it like the rest of the people did.

edit: never mind what i said about what ever and stuff, the game is awesome! i had trouble starting up the game with the new update but i realised if you switch between different versions of the game, that might also work to avoid the infinite loading screen! now that i have been playing the game a lot, i also realised that there is a auto sizing system and i just did not see it, im very sorry for criticising  about something that you guys have not done, im sorry. i also only have one recommendation to this game...multiplayer! please add multiplayer to the game and a fully functional one. the multiplayer mods suck.

if they fix the melee issues then its a 4 star for sure,1670373480,5,"Hi Blurred_Envy,

Thank you for your review.

Could you, please, tell what do you mean by ¡°the melee is a little wonky¡±?

---

All melee weapons in our game are divided into 3 types.

1. The weapon for which it¡¯s enough to be held with one hand.
In this case, when holding the weapon with one hand it is maximally static and completely follows the hand movement without delays.

2. The weapon which can be held just as with one hand so with two hands.

In this case, when holding the weapon with one hand it can a bit ¡°lag behind¡± in motion under its own weight. Also, when holding the weapon low (not on center) it can tilt under its own weight.

In this case, to fix the weapon it¡¯s necessary either to hold it with two hands-on impact or to hold it on center.

3. The weapon which needs to be held with two hands.

For example, a sledgehammer, a large piece of steel reinforcement or two-hand bat.

When holding this weapon with one hand, it will be bending very much under the weight, and it¡¯ll be very hard to deliver a blow.

----

When we were implementing melee weapons, we tried to maximally reproduce the weight and size of a weapon in order to diversify it.

If your complaint was just about this, then, please, try to change the spot on the weapon where you hold it and see how will its behavior change.

Also, try two-hand holding.

Should this information help to solve the problem you faced ¨C we¡¯ll appreciate if you find a minute to revise your review.

If there is another problem ¨C please, write to us at info@dream-dev.com.

Thanks.",128672

"the wizards; dark times could end up to be one of the best vr games to play. however, currently it is not.

the core idea of this game is to let hand movement determine what spell you are casting and how powerfull that spell is. this is the best magic gameplay i have ever played. the spells are well made and even more fun than in carbon studios previous game the wizards. 
the levels are original and well made (even if it is rather linear) and the narration as you progress is a nice touch.

great as these are, the games has some problems. a lot of rocks, tree's and mushroom have large invisible hitboxes. trying to shoot arrows between tree's and from behind rocks will not do. you will only hit these hitboxes. the stairs and ramps have collison issues where you can not walk up the stairs normaly and need to take a step back to walk around the center of the stairs. some levels have clipping ussues and flying models like mushrooms and rocks.
the enemies in this game are very simple, they have one or two attacks and thats it. they wont dodge or hide. to make the game more challenging as you progress the game will simply throw in more enemies. once you get a decent area of impact spell the game becomes a walk in the park. or you take a shield in one hand and spam throw with the other, that works as well.

"i have had the original oculus quest since launch day and this is the best shooter game i have played on it since day one. 


i would not consider myself good at fps games nor have i played any other battle royale games, but when playing this game it just works. graphics-wise, even on the quest 1, it looks really good. i love that you can climb and that the controls are very responsive. 


it took me a few rounds to figure out if my microphone was working, i finally realized i could look at the min-map and view the microphone icon next to my name to see if it's working.


i only play a couple rounds at a time, but i already want to play again. i like that you are on a team vs having to go at it alone. i have probably played about 6 or 7 matches and although it's the same map each time, the boundary affect of it has made it different each time. i look forward to more updates over time.

just a note to christians on the content: there is a witch's hut level that i didn't complete, so i can't finish the game. i am cool with sword and sorcery-style magic, or harry potter type stuff, but i avoid anything in games that begins to approach realism. this level won't bother every christian but it started to feel a little too much like i was imitating witchcraft so i stopped. you have to combine potions in a cauldron, for example, and that wasn't too realistic, but then as i progressed through the level there were a few activities that just felt weird and occultic so i stopped. you might read up on it this level a bit before buying. in general though it's a great game, very well done.",1648030560,5, ,130241
"kingspray is a really nice alternative to real life graffiti and it has more benefits than real life graffiti. the following pros and cons of this game are.
               pros
1. no risk of getting caught by law enforcement or private property owners.
2. able to start over or undo when a mistake has been made
3. can be used to practice for real world graffiti if you dont have anything to spray on at home / write on at home.


                cons
1. there is no mops or markers in this game like the ones used in real world graffiti.
2. no walking / running like locomotion.
3. no setting to turn off the bunker music.


these pros and cons are all based on my opinion of the game, but i think that this game is a well made great game to play when you're either bored and need something to do or want to practice your tags or throwies so you can perfect them and do them in real life if you are a real life graffiti artist. i do wish that there were marker pens and the small mop containers that when you squeeze paint comes out. and i also wish you could go inside the train on the subway map and i wish that there were new maps. in conclusion, this game is a great activity to do and i hope that in the future there will be new updates.",1718023463,0,,167084529

"i would love to recommend this game but it has too many frustrating bugs that prevent it from being an amazing game.  hence why i'm giving it a negative review to shed some light on some game-breaking mechanics.  if you don't care about how the game scores, skip to the last paragraph.

first off is the annoying ""phantom swing"" bug, where you physically see your saber going through a block and it not counting as a hit.  in my experience as a wmr user, this makes it impossible to full counter any song as the game's hit detection is sometimes a little too strict.  i've had this happen on random hits and sometimes even on full phrases of a song.

second is how the game works as a rhythm game.  the scoring system is completely counterintuitave, with score being calculated on angles of the swing before and after hitting the block, as well as going for ""symmetry"".  this is a cool concept, but any song that requires any sort of difficulty makes this impossible to do.  not only this, but once again the hit detection is fully against how rhythm games are supposed to work.  this can include the following hits behind your viewpoint:

[list]

[*] hitting a block that you missed in-time.
[*] hitting a already broken red box with the follow through of your blue saber, causing a reset of your combo.  an already broken box should not have an active hit box.  can't believe this was an aftersight by the developers.
[*] hitting a mine that you already passed with the follow through of your swing (as you need that for high score), causing a reset of your combo.

[/list]

honestly, i'm fine with the ""phantom swing"" as it could be partly due to wmr tracking, but the scoring system needs to be reworked.  simply removing hitboxes after the beat has passed inthe song would help tremendously.  currently it feels like you have a entire quarter note of time to hit a block, when it should only give you an eigth or a sixteenth note timeframe to hit that block, just like a normal rhythm game gives you.

all of these bugs in my experience cause the score system to be completely pointless as the game purposely forces you to not reach a high score.  the only way i can recommend this game is if you like the workout or can look past the score and combo system.",1530457193,2,0,647674

"ok, so, if you're new to ""the climb"" franchise, i heavily recommend you purchase the climb 2 first. it is by far the superior game, its leaderboard  function works, and there's no ""running storyline"" or anything, so it's not like you'll jump in on the middle of a story or anything. i would 100000% recommend starting with the climb 2, see if you like it, and then evaluate whether or not you'd like to buy this one. 

ok - now that you're back from the climb 2, do you want to buy this one? well, i would say only if you really loved the climb 2 that you won't really mind basically purchasing the same game with reduced features... but still want some different routes. i bought this one on sale and i'm not terribly disappointed, but i think some people would find the ""downgrades"" to be a turn-off.

first of all, the leaderboard doesn't work... at all. that is one of the really great features of tc2 - doing a climb, then seeing how you stacked up against other climbers. from what i can tell from other reviews, it seems this has been an issue for a long time - i have very little hope this is something that will get fixed. so, prepare to have your own personal high scores, and that's it. 

comparison to tc2:
the chalking mechanism takes a little longer, but not so long that it's a deal breaker. the ""cleaning dirty grips"" function is just plain awful, and one of the things that really gets in the way of me enjoying it as i did tc2: rather than just reaching out and cleaning the grip, you have to ""search around"" the grip for some magical, invisible spot that will trigger the cleaning. that one is kinda annoying. the graphics are mildly less beautiful, but not so much so that you lose that feel of climbing. there are a few little buggy things that might make you lose immersion.. for example, sometimes things get a little jumpy and it feels like you're jerking around, and sometimes the ""reposition yourself because you're 'inside' of something"" pops up when you're clearly not inside of something, and a few times i've had to make blind leaps. it's basically the same locations as before (minus city and north), but different routes and different things to encounter. otherwise, it's mostly the same, just different ways of climbing to the top. 

conclusion: i gave this four stars rather than 5 because of the broken leaderboards - that takes away one of the huge draws of tc2. yes, it's got a few annoying little things, but it's still the climb... if you're a huge fan of tc2, then i would recommend this one. otherwise, just stick with tc2.",1669565640,5, ,181556

the fact that 1 man can make a better vr game than 95% of large vr studios is crazy. then again this guy did contract work at valve, he knows his stuff.
if you're looking for a fantastic mostly linear, story driven singleplayer game, a half-like, or just another good vr game to play, do yourself a favor and play this game.
tons of weapons, branching story paths for slightly different playthroughs, lots of enemy types, tons of bosses, and lots of level diversity. 
new mechanics, weapons, set pieces, and other cool ""things"" you get to do (i don't want to spoil these moments for you) happen quite often and the game doesn't let you play for too long without introducing something new.

you can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/aq3iwd2n0ju

john wick in vr mixed with beat saber would be the lazy way to describe this game and not very helpful to anyone trying to make a purchase decision. in some ways, this game is hard to describe. yes, it's a music rhythm game in vr. however, the shooting element does throw things for the loop because you are supposed to shoot to the beat of the music ... but you don't have to.

you're not given any visual cue about that and that's not even mentioned in the tutorial. you only begin to notice when you see your score isn't as high for shooting some of the enemies. then you realize, oh, i'm supposed to be shooting to the beat of the music to get a higher score. 

do you have a great music ear? well, i play guitar and i think i don't have a great music ear, but definitely better than average i would say. i could hear the beat sometimes and shoot accordingly, but a lot of time i couldn't. i just don't hear it. i'm sure some of it is unfamiliarity with the music soundtrack. i'm sure the more you play the music and hear it, the easier it will be to hear the beat of the music. the problem is that i've been watching several video gameplays for this title and nobody was shooting to the beat. people were playing this like a normal shooter. you shoot as soon as you see the enemy and dodge. that's almost instinctual as a gamer.

the best game to compare this one to would be audica. that is also a vr music rhythm game involving shooting. i had more fun playing audica. i think there's more depth to that gameplay, but even more importantly,the gameplay elements there coalesce with the beat of the music and it helps you appreciate the music more when those elements come together almost instinctually. they really never came together for me while playing this game. it's like secret, hidden challenge ... but it doesn't make the game more fun or make you feel immersed in the music. 

i think that's the major problem with this game. of course, they can add visual cues and i think that will help a ton. however, not sure that the action of shooting itself unless it feels a part of the music will bring this game to the top tier of vr rhythm vr games. the other problem is that the shooting itself isn't as fun as other shooters in vr.

still, this is a good game. i got a good workout and it feels cool to shoot stuff while listening to the very good soundtrack. i like the visual art-style as well. for me though, the gameplay elements are just good, not great. 

[b]rate 7.5/10. definitely in my top 10 list of vr music rhythm games, but definitely not in my top 5 list of vr music rhythm games. [/b]",1573186381,3,1,378886

 not sure how many fights there are but opponents keep showing up a bit like old school ring king.  needs more updates.  as it stands, the game is a glorified punching bag simulator that's a pretty decent workout.

"tldr: 
the game has potential, for sure, and i'll be keeping an eye on it, but it's not there yet for me.

review:
while i am marking this down as a ""not recommended"", that is purely for me and i can easily see many other people enjoying the game.  the developer is super active, constantly putting out hotfixes, patches and new content. in the month that i've owned this game, he's consistently put out 1-2 patches per week. he even helped me out personally on the discord with an issue i was having with the game. 

for me though, the issues outweigh the fun of the game. issues like lighting through steamvr being so bad that you can't see the dirt path under your feet because everything is too dark.  you cannot see the bottom of an open box in the middle of the day, and need to use your flashlight to see into it. (good luck finding an item that fell on the ground because it failed to be put away). unless you buy virtual desktop from the meta store. then it's still incredibly dark, but you can see shades of the dark to see where your feet should be going.

issues like the human enemies being able to see you perfectly through the fog, through the bushes, and through walls, and being able to aggro and shoot you from outside of visible distance, killing you in 2-3 shots while taking anywhere between 0.5 to 1.5 clips of ammo to kill per person. in addition, the gun sights not are not aligned properly, so trying to use the iron sights to aim from any sort of distance beyond point blank is a guessing game. you need to use the laser sight to snipe, but they are not available for purchase.

the game is slow. extremely slow, for the most part. there is no running, no jogging,  most of your gameplay time will be walking through the dark and figuring out how to shove more things into your backpack.",1729068340,0,,177143177

but the rest of the game is a blast to play and it is very fun.

 a few things i would like to see added tho is a height recalibrate button in game, because when you for instance join a game sitting on the floor and you stand up you just see a black screen and you are forced to play the entire match sitting down.

Hi MontyFlange:

Thank you for your comments.

"there's isn't much to say. 

mods are almost obligatory, and honestly i wouldn't recommend playing vanilla anyway. 
downloading all the special edition patches, vrik and a few quality of life vr mods and you're good to go.
i don't think there's a game that immerses you as skyrim vr. shouting fus roh as loud as i can really makes you feel like a true dragonborn.",1593278886,0,0,606808
"i don't think i can say anything new about why this game is amazing.
the immersion is fantastic, the world building also excellent with great writing and voice work. 
the game runs exceptionally well and the amount of things you can do are astounding. want to grab a plank of wood and swat a headcrab as it jumps at you? go ahead! out of bullets? throw your empty magazine at an enemy to make them duck away to give you a chance to get into cover! the interactions this game gives you make it truly feel more like you're experiencing something than playing a game.

i played on a quest 2 with virtual desktop and experienced little hiccups aside for some crashes during chapter loading scenes (endless loading loop) but these just made me reset and load the game right back up as i wanted to keep playing.

if i had one gripe, which i will try and keep spoiler free, it is that the last chapter introduces a new variant of a combat mechanic and the controls performing this action, for me at least, did not feel 100% which broke the immersion somewhat. this was because what i feel that i was doing with my hands and what the game was showing me to be doing was not in sync so it removed me from the experience for that particular section. i may be in the minority with regards to this however and you may breeze through it. 

overall though this is an incredible experience and i hope we can expect more great games from valve!",1609843529,0,0,533775
"first off let me just say this game doesn't nearly look as good as pavlov but that is due to a lot of things mainly due to how large the maps are and all the factors in play. while in pavlov the maps are smaller making it take up less of the quests processing power. 



now onto talking about the game. the fact you got turbine into the game is great it adds so much to the game and i never thought i would be able to play it on the quest 2. now i am a little disappointed that only 2 weapons were added but that doesnt really matter. 



now since added turbine i was wondering could you guys or girls possible be able to due a p.o.w camp map.

"i am terrible at golf, but even then, this is such a fan and amazing game to play with friends during the winter months (when courses aren't open)... and even in the other months of the year too.  would highly recommend to anyone with any interest in golf!",1653922800,5, ,185146
what a great game for the low low price of free. genuinely a really fun and realistic vr zombie shooter. the fights are so fun and i highly recommend.,1707704295,0,,158127452

"at first glance i thought this was just another vr arena shooter. but then, after i started to unlock some weapons, unlock the advanced movement, learn some of the spells, i realized the incredible skill ceiling of this game and the power fantasy that comes with that. you will very much go from barely able to survive the first couple levels to a god of destruction, all through player skill. go from barely being able to aim your pistols to backflipping through air unloading dual wielded pistols into a giant demons face.

"[strike]the best vr experience, this should be the new benchmark.[/strike]

well... when you compare it to half-life: alyx then this game is nothing to write home about. but if you compare it to the rest of the vr games out there then this is one of the better ones. 

if you've never played half-life: alyx then i'm sure you will have a great time with this, i did. but once you've played alyx you will quickly start to see where this game falls short. your arms and legs feel like they're made of rubber, doing quick movements is impossible in this game since the hands in-game game slowly follows your vr controllers, making it seem like the character your controlling is drunk. the save system is also complete dog-sh?t, going back to the early 2000's with save-points that are like 40 minutes apart.

the entire game feels slow, you will have fun with this game but it has way to much down-time and everytime you start the game you have to confirm your height and whether you're standing or sitting down.

5/10 the climbing in this game is the best part, the rest is wonky as hell.",1576322623,0,0,722992
"when i first got the game, i had a blast drilling throgh hoardes of robots and racking up my high score, and the bullet-catching feature was definitely amazing to experience first-hand. after the first few levels, however, the game got repetitive: enemies were no longer a challenge, and the weapons weren't as exciting to wield. don't let this review scare you away if you're looking for a quick, fast-paced experience; this games delivers exactly that!",1659460560,5, ,313649

"breathtaking, and a great representation of the feeling of presence that the vive gives.

however, i wish there was more to do than just look around. it needs workshop support, or some kind of externally accessible api so modders could have their way with this wonderful playground.",1480128977,3,0,439943
"cool story, feels immersive enough to try other vr games, great setting for cthulhu fans. unfortunatelly very short and one-time action for couple of hours. definetelly get it on sale.",1578972214,5, ,311234
"i recommend this game but only with a couple caveats, those being: 

1. do not pay full price. the main game portion is only about an hour so there is not much content here. i paid around $7 cad and even that is pushing the value boundary. there are some puzzles from the riddler in there that i have yet to explore so i cannot speak to how much extra those add.

2. only get it if you want a more casual vr experience as opposed to a full fledged game. the interaction level although neat and polished, is pretty limited and you only do a few thing before the game is over.  i view this more as a taste of vr, its casual nature and lack of major movement requirement make it a good set piece to show off vr to friends, but beyond that there isn't much replayability. 

the experience itself is pretty cool, the graphics look really good and if you are a fan of batman you might enjoy this. at full price you will likely be very disappointed. so much more could have been done to make this a full game, but as it stands this feels more like a $30 demo.",1602454007,3,0,504575

"i arrived at death's door step. surrounded in a cocophany of red and blue. it was my sworn duty to strike down my enemies. so i roared and i rampaged. my katana being my only companion, my only possession, my only sense of purpose. 

[quote]when engaged in combat, the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern. suppress all human emotion and compassion. kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be lord god or buddha himself. this truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.[/quote]

so i struck the walls of my prison until i could strike no more. blood spilled from the heavens. yet i was no further from where i first started. i could see the walls breathing. i could see the futility of my existence. so then i decided to do the one last thing i had the power to do. i commited seppuku. 

alas, in this existence i cannot die. what is dead, may never die. i must be in hell. i had to force quit vr.",1596749078,3,3,402714

"this game is really gimmicky, despite many reviews; i'm a diehard lfd1/2 fan with hundreds of hours on and off steam, and i cannot really stand this game. not particularly good looking, intuitive, or engaging. it's just zombie shooting. for $20 i can't complain too much, until i realize that killing floor is an amazing game for a little more, yet another game i play religiously.

i cannot recommend this game at $20, the current sale. i am currently requesting a refund. it's not a terrible game, but it really didn't grab me. i really have no desire to continue, seen all i wanted to see. all people are different, maybe you'll have a blast. i didn't, that's it.",1527571240,2,0,435836

the middle of the game its starts picking up speed and is actually fun. (this is like 1 hour in).

but then later (one and a half hour) you have a encounter it stopped.

just sad to see the end credits come up so soon.

yes there is playability for collecting all the things, but seems no new story elements.

hope the dlc will be free and longer... or one of those two at least.

but the quility and polish is super high, the gameplay is fun (flat screen trailers don't do it justice)!

try to join a game but your name will not appear, and finaly realize that you will be kicked out of the game like a mentioned before.
and yes i did try to close the game and restart the oculus quest....
so it's a lottery if you are lucky you will be able to actualy play a game.
now you did it, you played a full game ....well sometimes the game freeze so eventually you will have to force to close the game.
so yes if you are able to actually play it's a very nice game but you paid for a finished game when it is not one....

"[played with oculus rift s and oculus quest (using sideloaded virtual desktop and oculus link)]

beat saber is an objectively flawless game. what it aims to achieve it has achieved perfectly. i can say that beat saber is one of the few perfect games out there. you slice blocks to the rhythm of a song with awesome visuals, and there's no real way to expand upon that...

except for one thing. the lack of customization in the game is an issue that is being resolved quite quickly and smoothly by the development team, and i appreciate them for that. however, despite the consistent updates with new songs and occasionally new features, i can't help but feel very restrained playing the base game.

i got bored with the actual game very quickly, until i learned about the endless possibilities and customization options that mods give the player. i can say without a doubt that i have spent at least 3x the amount of time playing modded content than the actual game, and i am of the belief that in order for a game itself to be considered good, you must enjoy the base content, and sadly, the base content gets dull pretty fast, unless you just got into vr and you are just having fun, which i fully understand.

the most popular mods are definitely the custom song mods, which allow people from all over the world to make their own songs and post them on websites for other people to enjoy, all for free, in contrast the paid dlc songs that would be the only escape otherwise to the boredom of the base game.

so, in conclusion,
-if you're new to vr and want to try something cool out, get it.
-if you're new to vr, and unwilling to mod your game, i wouldn't recommend it as much.
-if you aren't new to vr, and you are unwilling to mod your game, i don't recommend it that much.
-if you are willing to mod your game, this is possibly one of the most entertaining and captivating games out there.",1590504641,0,0,630863

"i don't support this practice of preorder bonuses that is unavailable post launch. and people shouldn't be paying before it's available anyway. at most it should be cosmetic, and not something like an actual loadout.

update:
finished the story mode. it's enjoyable. good performance on the quest 2 for the most part. some bugs here and there (like upgrading the ship not reflected on the ui until reload) and typos here and there but nothing extremely gamebreaking. took me a while to understand a few idiosyncrasies that really should've been in the tutorial. also there is not a lot of time to enjoy the big fleet you've gathered before it just ends way too quickly.

in my view, the biggest problem is the replayability. as far as i can tell, the missions in the story mode are exactly the same between runs, even the rewards. (if there were differences, they were very minor.) there is imo not a lot of reasons to replay it apart from some difficulty settings and the starting ships.

the skirmish mode also lacks any randomization or continuity which similarly affects replayability. we need something akin to survival mode like for example in bomber crew, or star treks voyages mode.",1624073014,5, ,88880
its a nice challenging game it also takes awhile to complete. not to mention the sandbox is quite fun to mess around with if you have the correct item.,1609378779,0,0,714386
"i can't recommend this game. it's not very good.
you are forced to start out with only the bow, and the bow is completely unweildy.
the draw length on the bow is longer than my arms are, and my shoulder starts to ache after 10 or so minutes of holding one arm at full extention non-stop.
eventually you get the crossbow which is a little more bearable but it has some bugs where sometimes you hand gets stuck holding it 2-handed style and its a pain to de-tach. it happens quite frequently. i've never even wanted it to do a 2-hand style but sometimes it just does it on its own.

that aside the enemies are extremely dull, slow, not much of a variety, and plain old boring.

the final nail in the coffin is the controls are horrendous.
the locomotion moves at a crawl. so slow its completely useless.
the teleport to move is also clunky and takes a long time to trigger. you have to wait for your arrow to land somewhere before you teleport there.
and finally the snap turning.
good god.
what kind of moron thinks that pressing the grip buttons is a good turning system?
whoever designed the controls needs to seriously re-think their life.

and to add insult to injury the game only saves in very far-between locations 'after' you kill a boss. so if you die on the boss you have to start all over, and even if you do make it there and manage to save your progress, you have a 50-50 chance the developer wont wipe your save by the next morning. for some extremely minor cosmetic patch.",1540087747,2,0,597188
"a must-buy for any pc-vr gamer. the game is constantly updated with new free content at an incredible pace, and features lots of game modes. i've spent hours in sandbox just playing with the hundreds of real and fictional weapons in the game, and 'take and hold' is one of the most addictive and replayable vr experiences i have ever played. cannot recommend enough!",1606434805,0,0,470195
"i purchase boxvr about 2 months ago, and i have played it almost every day. i actually looked forward to doing exercise for the first time in my life. after an hour of boxvr i would be tired, but would keep playing, just for fun. surprise, i open my oculus, and boxvr is gone, replaced with something new... fitxr, or the vr version of new coke, for those of you old enough to remember that debacle.

fitxr has taken the joy out of my workouts, now i am watching the clock, just waiting for this garbage show to finish. i will keep using it, because it is a good work out, but i would really appreciate some sort of access to the game that i actually purchased. this game has too much visual stimulation, with clocks, power bars, levels, explosions, scoreboards, lined pathway where the ugly mushroom shaped things fly at you... its overkill and completely ruins the minimalist asthetic that i think so many of the people loved about boxvr.

- typing stuff on a real keyboard without having to take off the headset, put it down, type something, put it back on and fit everything again. especially convenient in vr apps where the textbox can't be seen unless the headset is pointing at it, but still supports real keyboards. this alone makes it worth the money.
- adjusting the portable a/c near my playspace

"i put off getting this game because it didn't have very much single player options at first look, and single player is what i am accustomed to playing in vr. but upon getting the game, i ended up putting hours into it in the first week with the various single player modes and even did an online mode with just myself playing against bots. after my confidence grew i started playing multiplayer only to find that there are a lot of decent people playing regularly and only a few raging aggressive types, which makes it much more enjoyable playing with a multitude of decent people. 
after a short while of playing i found this game is not only a fantastic multiplayer shooter, but with a couple of mods available through the main menu, you can suddenly turn it into a call of duty like game even playing on loads of the old maps from modern warfare, world and war, and black ops. then with another mod you can be playing as a spartan in halo on halo maps with various weapons from the halo games, there is even star wars maps and weapon loadouts. 
i just didn't realise how good this game was until i played it. there are a few single player modes, co-op modes, and a huge variety of multiplayer modes, with more being added by the modding community constantly. the developers are putting up regular updates too as i've already received a couple in the short time of owning the game.
the graphics, maps/modes, gameplay, weapons and physics are fantastic! if you enjoy fast action and combat in a call of duty/halo style of gameplay but in virtual reality, then i highly recommend this game!",1664799101,0,,123282368

"while i enjoy rhythm based games, they are not my normal go to.

i waited to see how beat saber development went before jumping in. altho still in ea, its been out almost a year and its [b]high rating[/b] and mod support got me to finally jump in. i can honestly say it deserves that rating!

some games just ""[b]do it right[/b]"". beat saber is that game. menus are clean and thought out (something i wish wasnt noteworthy, but in the realm of vr games, its a real mixed bag). it doesnt take 30 seconds of your first song before you know things just [b]feel right[/b]. every detail is on point.

you can really work up a [b]sweat[/b] too! whether thats a pro or con, you can decide!

the game has a pretty [b]limited[/b] number of official tracks (about a dozen.) there is i think a dlc music pack coming. but, the game has a large mod base, where users can create their own beat tracks. its very easy to setup, a small download and a drag n drop, and you are good to go!

should you find yourself drowning in new modded tracks, deleting or [b]favouriting[/b] tracks is easy to do.

i purchased the game for 18 and regret nothing! if you are in any way intrigued by this title/genre, pull the trigger and start your maniacal box slicing time now ;)",1551668771,3,1,643960

"this was one of my favorite games after buying my vive.  i have 28 hours into it, but i had issues.  if playing more than a 30m it would always hang in the middle of a song.  i stupidly assumed it was because my pc was at the minimum of what steam recommended (or my video card was overheating).  after spending a non-trival amount of money upgrading to a 1080ti and latest i5, it actually hangs even more frequently.  i now can't even get through a single song without it showing a loading screen or hanging...such a waste of time money and a huge disapppointment for what could have been an amazing game.  look at the last time it was updated and their update notes.  look at the other reviews, which clearly state the same issues with it crashing.",1494999661,3,0,448118
"the game was good till mission 1.4 (maybe a different mission) where i had to go up the elevator and did all the steps to open it but nothing happened i've repeated the missions twice with the same results. the ai isn't fantastic all the time either, i will be behind a guy, at the slowest speed, and he would somehow tell i was there before i even yell freeze or knock him out. the room im in is quiet and im not making any sound but they will still randomly catch me, which makes thing really frustrating during challenges.you cannot activate cheats either, it just won't let you activate them. if you have unlocked them then the game needs to say so. there were a couple times when i shot my gun in the slow down time mode by holding down the button and my gun shot to the left of the barrel at a 45* degree angle so, there's that.",1574911414,5,"Hi! First and foremost we want to sincerely apologise about how late our response is to your feedback. We appreciate we should've actioned our early post launch reviews sooner, regrettably we didn't and we hope you can forgive us for that. Secondly thanks for taking the time to leave us a constructive review. We're not sure if you eventually figured out how to complete mission 1.4 but to activate the elevator you need to have the shotgun you find in the office equipped. That specific shotgun serves as a weapon as well as a keycard and you need to have it equipped once you stand next to the elevator to open it up. In regards to the AI behaviour and stability we apologise about this. At the time we had a lot of difficulty in getting the AI to correctly react to each situation and there were a lot of bugs involved. However we have made vast improvements over the best part of a year and a half addressing many facets of the game and improving them where possible and the AI has been one of them we've actively focused on improving across all our updates. We're unsure when the last time you may have played Espire might've been but you should now find the AI to be a lot more stable and realistic. :) Other huge improvements we've made centre around the graphics, the performance, reduced loading times, many quality of life improvements, additional weapons, and additional challenges in the challenges mode as well as new maps. We trust you'll have a far better experience if you decide to play the game again. :) Just to explain the cheats to you also, these are unlocked by completing what we call Espire trials which are the side challenges you can attempt during the main campaign. You can find these on the mission select screen by going to a mission portrait and then to the left of that you should see some boxes with illustrations on. These are the trials and If you hover your controller over these it will outline the trial name and what you need to do to pass it. (Destroy all surveillance cameras on mission 1.1 as an example) There are trials in each mission and completing these will subsequently unlock cheats from the cheats menu for some more added fun and replayability. We hope that helps and clears that up. Thanks again for the constructive review and again really sorry about the late response to this.",156388
"i was naive enough to think that developers can develop a realistic ping pong game. if you ever played ping pong in the real life and you are somewhat good at it, you will not enjoy either ping pong game on quest store. this game is much closer to the real experience than other pingpong game but far from the real experience. the reason for that is that the game is missing a lot of real life factors . i have 3 stars for developer teams effort. i uninstalled the game. i rather play the real ping pong than playing against a robot returns the serve 250 mph.",1592623414,5, ,90623

"this game is a great start, but has some room to improve:

pros:
- imersive environment
- decent physics (ball distance is short)
- realistic golf feel
- putting is very nice
- huge growth potential

cons:
- must hold trigger to hold club - makes for akward grip
- graphics performance is poor (1060, 16gb, i7)
- shot distance is about 50% of real life. 
- accidental ball hits at adress (need on your honor muligans)
- no multiplayer support
- bag is easily knocked over


suggestions for added features:

- multiplayer
- various club sets to include hybrids, different putters, etc. 
- more detailed swing analysis
- add driving range and practice area
- enter actual club length and player height 
- a golf cart would actually be really cool!

if there was a way to integrate this into a launch monitor like the gc2, trackman, skytrak, etc then the ball flight physics would be improved and this could be more of a simulator quality. adding some hardware options for clubs would be great to increase the feel of the game. all in all this is a great start and i look forward to the growth of this game. great job devs!!!",1477273403,3,1,492643

"thanks for the key! i have yet to try it really thoroughly so this might get edited in the future. really interesting way to select spells! really different from in wands. it's a bit more immersive, but sadly also much much slower and less accurate. first thing i noticed is that it's really hard to aim the fireballs. it's a bit easier when it knows which target you're aiming at, but generally, it's hard to figure out how to do it with a 3dof controller. that said, i probably couldn't do it better so take it with a grain of salt.
the power challenge had a bit of a bug. when it ends when you're throwing fireballs at it, the fireball keeps hopping up and down for a while in the place the red crystal used to be.
i'm not really sure yet about how much replay value this game will have but we'll see.

"load time is about 5 minutes sometimes to get going.i don't have time for all that extra waiting around and it really should be just a case of circles flying at the player to hit.

after half a year i came back to try. the last song i tried was the only course i remembered that would slightly get my heart going and as of today all these months later i was expecting mybe 10 free expert classes and say 25 paid for classes but logging on i could see a total of.... 1 expert classes inter entire game...

i was offered an extra 7 days free trial so i choose to try this assuming surely there're loads of expert classes in the paid for version? and after signing back up there is a total of 1 still.

only 1 expert class and that's ya lot.

there are similar games out there which make you sweat more and are totally free on sidequest.

or for a real workout, thrill of the fight put is on the floor and we are gym trainers ourselves.

this game for the most part suits my grandmother who is in her 80s with a paced installed, and i cannot get over that after all these months there is nothing new other than a filter for filtering out the 1 and only expert class.

needless to say i'm done with this game and feel extremely let down as i supported it all the way.

there is little to justify buying the standalone game as the classes are suitable for pregnant ladies or my grandmother, and the subscription is the same as it was months ago.",1662591720,5, ,170595

"this game has provided me with some of the most realistic and awesome experiences that i have ever had in my 25 plus years of gaming. sure there is half life alyx and pavlov vr , arizona sunshine and twd sas but even with all those great titles and i'm sure some i forgot , for some reason this game just feels better. if you have decent hardware (lack thereof can severely disrupt your experience) then you really owe it to yourself to buy and try this title , the story of arthur ford is a very complex and confusing one with almost endless speculations to fill some holes in the story line , along with this its also worth noting that some of the game play can be a little clunky at some times and on some levels but somehow it just works so beautifully. additionally if you understand the world of pc modding you can also add a multiplayer experience called entanglement effectively allowing you to play with other players all the way through the game if you like , just be prepared to learn or use discord as it is required. all in all this game is a 10/10 and i really hope slz are releasing project 4 sometime next year , don't cheat yourself and grab a copy of boneworks and try it.",1639683861,0,0,710026
